evuqbn,"New Title (Format), New Rule",1580366414.0,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/evuqbn/new_title_format_new_rule/,"**UPDATE 3:** Due to some confusion, [Question] is changed to [Discussion]

**UPDATE 2:** We've notice that a families get caught in the [IWantOut] filter, as the format was deliberate designed around single person requests. In the interest of inclusion, we've added a [WeWantOut] format specifically for couples/families/groups. It's almost identical to the [IWantOut] format except multiple Age&Sex can be input.

**UPDATE 1:** As I wrote originally, there were still going to be things to work out. Well, that was true. Going forward [Question] posts are going to have the same rules as /r/AskReddit, in that they cannot have a body. A bunch of people abused the tag to get past the title format filter.

## What's happening

So we posted a call for feedback a couple weeks ago about removing the ""-> anywhere"" rule. The issue that it's trying to fix is the low-effort, lazy posts that don't contain any information. The rule in its current form doesn't work (since the vast majority of people are able to get past it by just listing basically every country).

So new plan, we're ditching that rule. Instead, we're going to try a mandatory title format. This way, anyone who finds out sub an immediately posts without reading the rules (this is unbelievably common) will be very obvious, and we'll be able to remove those posts quickly.

Rule 4 is going to change to be ""No posts that do not meet the title format"". If you see a post not meeting the title format, it's easy to report. The title format isn't hard to follow. Additionally, the automod will be doing the filtering.


## Why this is happening

We largely want the sub to be able to operate without too much mod control. And we've always had the issue of tons of low effort posts. Seriously, if people don't have the ability to do a basic search, they aren't going to be able to handle immigration.

The thing was, that every new rule we created, crap posts would get past it. We created a rule that said accounts needed to be more than 2 days old to post, so people just wait 2 days to post their spam (and they never both to read the rules or do a search in those two days). We created a rule saying that ""anywhere"" is not a destination, so people post every country as a destination. And every one of these rules blocked plenty of legit posts, most of which ended up messaging modmail.

So basically, we had a whole bunch of automod rules that didn't do too much to stop spam and did far too much stopping legitimate posts.

Hopefully, this will fix all that. Gone is the anti everywhere filter, gone is the new account filter, reduced is the rule 3 minimum content limit filter (seriously, we still expect a body to posts), and in their place we have a new title format filter. 

As /u/TheGameYouLostIt (who has the honor of being the first person to get past the title format filter) said ""If I can't post on reddit, I'm not going to be able to immigrate"", which is exactly the idea.

## The Format

[POST TYPE] Age&Sex Profession Country of Origin -> Target Destination

I've built a filter that should be broad enough to allow everything that fits in this format to pass through 

At first, our post types are the following:

* **[IWantOut]**  Used for asking for specific advice/information
* **[Question]**  Used for asking a general question (not about your specific situation) - these will be more specifically monitored
* **[News]** Used for sharing immigration related news
* **[Meta]** Used for discussion of the subreddit as a whole.

As for the other parts of the title format,

* **Age** Your age. If you don't want to reveal your specific age, then put either a range ""25-35"" or a decade ""20s"", ""30s"", etc. Age is a factor for a lot of visas/immigration schemes and it is necessary information. We don't need a specific age, but we do need some useful information here.

* **Sex** Your sex/gender (yes I know, they aren't the same thing). This is less important, as it usually doesn't make a difference with the majority of immigration schemes. Include whatever letter/sequence of letters you think best describes you, ""F"", ""M"", ""FtM"", ""NB"", etc. If you wish not to include it, put an ""X"" (just so we know you're acknowledging the format).

* **Profession** This is what you do for a living, preferably in 1 or 2 words. We understand that situations are complicated, so this isn't a required part of the title. You can choose not to include it if your situation is more complicated than 1 or 2 words.

* **Country of Origin** This is the country/countries that you are a citizen of. This is incredibly important because visa rules differ greatly based on country of origin. It is not sufficient to say a region, we need to know the actual country. If you are concerned about being identified, you're welcome to use a throwaway.

* **->** This is an arrow. This is how the arrow is formatted. It'll be a primary way that we check for compliance with the title format. **>**, **---**, **--->** aren't arrows according to our format. *Note: If this ends up being too big of a problem, we may drop this requirement, but to start off, we're going to be pretty strict on the arrow thing*.

* **Destination Country**. This is where you want to go. As per what is written above, ""anywhere"" is now an acceptable destination. If you put a region/""anywhere"" you have to give us specifics about where you want to go. For example, tell us the climate of the country you want to go to, or that you want housing to be affordable, or etc. There are too many countries in the world for your requirements to just be ""not the one I'm currently in"".

You still need to have a body to **[IWantOut]** posts. We still need to know your educational background, your job experience (specifically, such as how long you've done what you've done), and your ""real job skills"" (again, specifically, ""computer skills"" is a nonsense term), and anything else you think is important to tell us.

Also, please don't throw extra stuff in your title, include it all in your post. The whole point of a mandatory title format  is to make it easier to find people who don't care enough about the advice to actually spend the time to post intelligently. A bunch of all caps ""NEED HELP IMMEDIATELY XOXOXOXO"" is definitely going to get your post removed.

Here are some examples of titles in the new format:

* [IWantOut] 25F US -> EU or USA
* [IWantOut] 36M Nurse Phillipines -> China\Japan\Korea
* [IWantOut] 20sMtF Programmer AUS -> Tajikistan
* [IWantOut] 32-42X Nigeria -> Anywhere
* [Question] What are your experiences accessing mental healthcare while living abroad?
* [News] Tajikistan is offering a new freelancer visa!
* [Meta] I'm so glad this sub has active mods who keep trying to improve the sub

Examples of posts that are definitely (at least at the beginning) going to get removed are as follows; **DON'T DO THESE**:

* IWantOut 25F US -> EU or USA
* [IWantOut] 36M Nurse Asia -> China\Japan\Korea
* [IWantOut] 20sMtF Programmer AUS --> Tajikistan
* [IWantOut] 32-42X Nigeria -> Anywhere :P
* [Question] Why does <insert country here> so racist?
* [News] Trump, BoLsOnArO, Xi, xI, Rahmon, Xi, TRUMP, TRUMP, Johnson, JoHnSoN, TRumP!?
* [Meta] Why the fuck can't I post?


[The wiki \(we have one now\) says everything that's in this post \(plus a little extra\).](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/wiki/titleformat)

[Additionally, we have a place to test titles to see if they meet the automod filter \(and you can look at the regex that the automod follows\).](https://regexr.com/4t6t0)


### Conclusion

So this was rolled out about 8 hours ago, and I've been watching/tweaking it. I've tried to make it as clear as possible. Several people have managed to post without messaging modmail for instructions (or following me weirdly commenting in a filtered post 2 mins after it was filter). **There are still going to be improvements**. I'm sure there are problems that we haven't noticed yet and those will come out in time (if you see one, please let me know). 

I'm making this post in the interest of transparency and in hopes of soliciting input on how to improve this. Hopefully this will make the subreddit better, and considering the posts that have be made since the new filter was rolled out, I'd say the early evidence is looking strong. We'll see how spam gets past this new filter (I swear it's like trying to drain a swamp with a tennis racket...)

If anyone has any questions, comments, idea or concerns, feel free to leave them below this post. We're aware that there will be growing pains, but this should improve the sub."

So I currently live in Zimbabwe, but fear there aren't many opportunities here for growth, and a stable job. So I was wondering how I can somehow move to South America and get a job there.

To give you some context, I have a Masters degree in Quantitative Risk Management from the University of Cape Town, in South Africa. I work well with the programming languages Python, R,  MATLAB and Stata, and have about 1.5 years experience in the business analyst/financial analyst role.

I am open to moving to any country in South America but would prefer Brazil/Argentina.

Any help would be welcome."

I'm run an agriculture IOT startup I'm funding with the $1.5M I got from a previous startup (where I was an early employee).  It more than qualifies for the capital requirements for DAFT or the Irish startup program ([https://workpermit.com/immigration/ireland/irish-visa-start-entrepreneur-programme](https://workpermit.com/immigration/ireland/irish-visa-start-entrepreneur-programme)). 

I don't have a degree, but I am a high earner (300k-500k/year).

If I get temporary residency through the entrepreneur programs can I reasonably expect permanent residency after 5 years?  Will not having a degree hinder me?

Should I just delete this thread and wait for the responses from the actual immigration attorneys I have messaged?  Has anyone else done this kind of move?

g88ih5,[IWantOut] 35F Carer Belgium -> UK,1587906133.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/g88ih5/iwantout_35f_carer_belgium_uk/,"I should clarify that I am from the UK but my husband is Belgian. We have lived in Belgium for 15 years now and have talked from day one about moving to the UK.

My husband has a severe form of epilepsy and is unable to work, and I am his carer. He receives a disability allowance that covers our expenses, some of which is provided since I am his carer.

I have read varying things about whether he can still claim his Belgian disability benefits while living in the UK. It is the main thing stopping us as we have no other means of income as I am unable to work due to his condition. 

We are getting older now and I find it very lonely and difficult being in Belgium, quite honestly I feel trapped there. When he is ill he is ‘not there’ and I am alone looking after him for days, weeks to sometimes months depending on the severity of his health. When we are back in the UK I have the support of my family and it’s such a relief to me to know they can pop over to see how we are doing. In Belgium we are alone. 

I have tried to look for what possibilities there would be for us but it’s such a difficult situation with his health, inability to work, my inability to work. We are desperate to make this move but we only can if he still receives his disability allowance when we are in the UK.

Is it possible? Or are we just fooling ourselves?"

Looking for some advice here. I’m a 23 year old soon to be college graduate in May. I’m finishing a B.S. in Hospitality and Tourism. 

I’m looking to improve my Spanish by immersing myself into Latin culture in South America. Since the pandemic I’ve been let go from my Hotel management job and I’ve been working on a horse farm here in central Kentucky. I am making decent money at the moment. The lease is up on my apartment in July and I’m thinking of moving back in with my Dad while I save up money for moving to South America.

I would like to live down there for a couple years. Hopefully even a different country every 6-9 months or so. I want to explore as much as possible. I’m okay with doing dirty work and will happily do odd jobs to help get by. How should I look for employment? What about visa requirements for a US citizen wanting to spend multiple years abroad? How much should I have saved up before I go?

Hopefully this isn’t too vague! I just have a desire to explore the world!! Thanks for listening. Best wishes."
g7y90x,[IWantOut] 30F Bartender USA -> Europe,1587867081.0,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/g7y90x/iwantout_30f_bartender_usa_europe/,"I want to try living somewhere new and experiencing a different culture outside the US. Over time Im feeling more and more like the US is not the right place for me. 

Citizenship/residency wont be an issue. I'm applying for Croatian citizenship through lineage. If all works out, I'll be a proud EU citizen. 

I speak English and Spanish fluently, and am learning French (but I have a long way to go). I bartend for a living and love it, though I know it doesnt pay as well in Europe. The rest of my work experience is in retail and administrative work. I have a BA in International Affairs/Studies. Other than bartending, none of them paid well and my skills arent that diverse because my city doesnt offer much opportunities for work. 
I'd prefer to keeping bartending, or have work where I get to move around, because I hate sitting at a desk all day. But hey, I'll take what will pay the bills in the end.

However, I'm wondering if the move would be worth what I'd be giving up here. I know Europe is a lot more laid back and has better working conditions, so maybe I wont burn out as easily.

Before the virus, I was objectively doing decently. I only had to work 3 days a week to make enough to cover all my living expenses with a little extra to have fun. I'll pick free time over an extravagant lifestyle anytime, because I get exhausted easily and need a lot of time to rest. (Health stuff) 

Other than all that, I'd prefer living somewhere relatively coastal, with plenty to do and where people are hopefully more friendly and down to earth. Also I have two cats I need to be able to bring with me. 

How feasible would such a move be? Would it be worth it? What do you think would be a good place for me to start over and be able to be financially secure? What are my employment options?

Thank you for any input!"

So [this](https://www.sovereignman.com/lifestyle-design/four-valuable-passports-that-anyone-can-obtain-6109/#spain) site says all it takes for me, as a Latin American, to get Spanish citizenship is to prove to the embassy that I've got 25k Euros in my bank account, then go and live there for two years on a non-lucrative resident visa..

This actually sounds doable, which makes me kinda skeptical given how impossible migrating has felt for years.


This info sounds kinda unnecessary but I'll add it just in case: I've got a US BA in International Affairs from a very well regarded school in the subject and 3 (almost 4) years of experience spanning the private, public, and non-profit sectors both in the US and in Costa Rica. I'm fluent in English, and friends that live in Spain tell me that makes it very easy to find a job there because apparently most of the population doesn't speak it very well."

I'm looking for some general advice and experiences of others! I'm a 21 year old male from New Zealand who has spent the last 3 years since finishing school working as a Sales Consultant for a Service Provider and have also worked my way into a leadership role to what is essentially a 3IC. I also had 3 years customer service experience prior to this. In 2019 I did a two month solo trip to the UK and mainland Europe and it solidified my desire to do this.  


I am currently in the process of getting registered on the Irish FBR (Foreign births register) through my ancestry which will allow me to get an Irish Passport which makes living and working in Ireland (and the rest of Europe) relatively easy. I am also under the understanding that post-brexit the CTA between Ireland and the UK will remain which allows me to live and work in the UK as well(?).

Ideally I'm wanting to find a job related to my experience but am open to new experiences but I do also want to travel during this time (at least initially)so something low hour wise/not to restrictive would be ideal. I am also interested in the potential to study somewhere, so suggestions on study locations and information like that would also be helpful. In terms of money, by December/Jan the time that I want to leave by (Covid-19 dependent) I should have at least $40,000NZD saved, so my budget is relatively open

I am interested in moving to the following places: Dublin, London, Brighton, Manchester and am also open to any other suggestions people have as well as any advice or knowledge about the places listed that it would be good to be aware of. I do also worry about the difficulty of making new friends (for example, outside of coworkers/flatmates) so if anyone has advice on forums/apps or just in general advice on how to go about this in big places that would be awesome.

I was really just hoping for some general guidance around a move like this from someone who has done it and for any additional information people can give me.

My interests are in contemporary nomadism, post-Soviet development and internationalization, processes of ethnic assimilation and preservation (particularly in the relationships, historical and present, between Turkic and Iranic populations in Central Asia, although more recently Russification is a big one), and frontier studies, particularly in relation to migration patterns in the wake of both the Soviet collapse and regional warfare. Since these are obviously some diverse interests (and I have others), I expect to narrow down my focus as I continue my studies over the next few years.

Currently I'm only in my first year of community college, but I plan to transfer to the University of Oregon within a year, where I'll major in anthropology. I have yet to decide whether I'm more interested in cultural anth or archaeology, but they don't offer an archaeology degree as such—I'd have to move east for that. Though I'm studying Persian on my own time right now, I'll also study it formally for the first time there. I also plan to study Russian and probably a Turkic language, maybe Uzbek.

My grades are excellent so far and I'm very interested in maintaining them so as to qualify for as many merit scholarships and grants as I may be eligible for. I'm from a financially disadvantaged background, yet for the time being cannot receive federal financial aid due to circumstances outside of my control, so that's been and will continue to be a major obstacle in realizing my ambitions.

Ideally, I'd like to explore opportunities for research in this region as soon as possible following my BA. I expect my MA to take me out of state at the least and quite possibly out of the US, and for the moment it's impossible to tell where I'll end up. Is it likely that I'll be able to begin fieldwork in this region before undertaking my MA?

My intent is definitely not to move to this region permanently. I'm interested in what steps I should be taking, short-term and long-term, in being able to work in this region within the next few years, and to establish a place for myself in the scholarship around it. What general advice would you give to other would-be scholars in my position? Any particular advice for my case?

My plan is to apply to German Master’s of Chemical Engineering programs that are taught at least partly in English.

My internship was through the DAAD RISE program, and I continued to work for the DAAD as an ambassador when I returned to America, so I think my chances of being accepted to a Master’s Program are okay given my history with the country’s academic programs and language. Looking for opinions here as to what my chances of acceptance might be.

My main question is -if I were to get my Master’s of Chemical Engineering in Germany, would I be able to return to America to and work as an engineer? I’ve generally thought that EU and USA had good exchange of accepting degrees except for professional schools like Law and Medicine. Has anyone returned or emigrated to the USA with a German engineering degree that can offer advice?

I've been reading the Thai immigration website but I find it useful to also speak to people who have done the complicated thing I'm trying to do.

My girlfriend currently manages the lessons department at the biggest store of a major retail instrument chain. 

I currently manage an iconic guitar store in NYC and I also have a background in teaching music.

With the way things are these days we're looking at options as far as where to go next and Thailand sorta meets all the criteria right now.

We'd love to hear about how getting work permits actually worked since it seems like a complicated process as well as what you thought of the expat community generally. We're also curious what employment opportunities exist for expats. We're both handy and quick on our feet so we could do whatever job we could get- if we could actually get one.

We're also totally open to hearing ""Thailand might not be as good an option as X country."" Basically anything y'all can tell us will be appreciated.

Thanks!"

I am currently in my 6th semester of electrical engineering. I am 22. I am considering to leave Germany behind for various reasons.

1. I don't like the german way of being conservative against any kind of new technology
2. I think the tax system is in serious need of fixing
3. I doesn't like the climate that much.

I am looking for a place similar to California, but with similarities to german in things like healthcare and social protection. But to get a better view first I was considering to do my masters in the land I am going to emigrate. I would love to work on cutting edge technology. So I am looking for a country with highly developed industry.

What countries can you suggest ?

I actually might have multiple ancestry paths via my father, but based on the documentation I have on hand so far, the line I am planning to use right now is the following:

Great grandfather - born 1878 in Augusta Sicily
Great grandmother - born 1889 in August Sicily

They were married 1911 in Augusta Sicily.  They came to the states shortly after. 

Grandmother was born 1923. 

Great grandfather is naturalized in 1925. 

Father is born in 1952. 

So, based on the concept of citizenship passing through blood (along with the other rules in place), my grandmother was passed Italian citizenship from my great grandfather because he was not yet a US citizen when she was born; because my father was born after 1948, that means he was passed the right to Italian citizenship from Grandma and then so on and so forth. 

So a few questions:

- Am I correct and the interpretation of the rules and how it applies to my case?
- I’ve already been in contact with Augusta’s Registrar of Vital Statistics to obtain the long form birth certificate; is the marriage registration important as well?
- I know this process will take a while (I won’t go to the consulate to apply until Nov of next year), but what are the subsequent steps (if it all works out of course) to getting my wife and child citizenship as well?

It would also be great to hear any success stories from anyone with a similar family history."

* I am a US citizen with a current passport (renewed this year due to name change).
* I have a bachelor’s in Accounting (May 2019), and an associate’s in Medical Administration with a      Concentration in Medical Transcription (December 2010). 
* I have worked in retail for a little over five years, about four years as a medical transcriptionist/patient registration, four months in data entry, and I am currently working as an AML analyst for a multinational bank as of February 2020. 

I am looking for any available avenue to get to the UK, and I will admit there is a bit of desperation that is creeping through. My fiancé is a British citizen, but due to being a type 1 diabetic and ongoing medical issues, he is unable to work and is barely scraping by with Universal Credit. 

Here is where the desperation is coming in: he has double retinal bleeds, and he is slowly going blind. He has already had two operations on his right eye to correct it, and it started clouding over again while there is blood in the left eye that hinders his vision. 

I have tried looking into several avenues to try and get over to England, which includes: 

**Tier 4 Student Visa**: As stated above, I have my bachelor's, so I was considering going over to obtain a master’s in accounting. However, I do not have the funds for the living expense required to obtain a Tier 4 student visa (£1,105/month when living outside of London, from my research). I would be able to stay at my fiancé’s during that time, but I doubt they would take that into consideration.

**Fiance Visa**: This was another option I had looked into, but our problem is that 1) he cannot work, so he does not meet the minimum salaried requirements, and 2) neither of us have enough in the bank to meet the financial requirements (£16,000, last I checked). I am slowly storing away money, but it would take a few years to get that much, which includes compensating for the exchange rate.

**Work Visa**: I was looking at jobs in the UK, but as a recent graduate with zero job or internship experience, it might be a hard sell to get a company to sponsor me. At that time, I had a dwindling savings account with no means to relocate. Right now, my savings are growing, and I already have a ticket to England for October (originally meant to visit my fiancé until I can move there on a more permanent basis). 

**Current Employment**: Right now, my best shot of making it over to England, in my eyes, is through my current employer. However, I have only been with the company for three months, and they require you to stay in your current position for a year. An exception may be possible if I could make a vertical movement within the company, but I believe they would only do that for someone with more seniority (and skill). 

I could make a plea, with my manager, to relocate to England for six months to help my fiancé, which is only possible due to a majority of our workforce working from home for the foreseeable future. I doubt it will go anywhere, but I am going to speak to him, off the record, about the possibility and what hoops I would need to jump through if it is. 

I have read where people have entered the country and started job hunting that way. Still, I want to remain as legitimate in my immigration as possible to avoid any kind of fallout (such as preventing me from marrying my fiancé). I have looked through everything I could think of, and I am trying to think logically about my situation. 

There was some consideration about bringing my fiancé over to the US, but I’m terrified our whole healthcare system (mostly insurance) would kill him. Despite working for a multinational bank, the health insurance I have isn’t that great, and what would I do if I lost my job when he got here?  

I am trying to familiarize myself with UK KYC/AML and have been attempting to become more acquainted with Excel formulas. However, while my current job uses Excel, they are big fans of pivot tables and not much else. I am also working on a CV and will attempt to apply to companies in the UK. 

I may be S.O.L. right now, but I would not be able to forgive myself if I didn’t try exhausting every possibility. Thank you for any and all advice."

I love to travel. I've visited 13 countries, but now I want to experience living in some of them. As a software engineer I see much better opportunities to grow and find my place in this world in one of my target countries (at least for now).

I'm single. I speak English, Russian, Kazakh and some French (like B1 or so).


**Destinations**:

So the countries where I would like to end up are (in order of decreasing priority):
- UK, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Canada (ON, QC, BC);
- Germany, USA (CA, NY, MA), the Netherlands, Denmark, Austria;
- Belgium, Luxembourg, Czech Republic, Poland;


**Experience**:

I've worked in several different industries and with different technologies: ~1 year in a bank developing internal corporate web services (both frontend and backend), ~1 year in an IT company as a intelligent automation engineer (designing and implementing data processing pipelines) working with RPA (using Selenium), Java and Groovy, ~1 year in the same company as a machine learning engineer implementing document classification and information extraction systems, and the last ~5 months still in the same company as a backend web developer doing regular backend stuff.


I'm passionate about programming, math and data. I'm willing to grow in data science and machine learning, but I'm still okay with any software engineering position. I'm eager to learn new things, I'm always enthusiastic about that. I've changed my domain and tech stack 3 times for the last 3 years and got used to new tools and technologies very quickly. So, it would be fine with any software engineering job, even those I haven't done before.


For the last ~6 months I've been trying to find a good job offer in my target countries, but I did not succeed much. And now there are worldwide lockdown and closed borders.


So for my future search and hopefully relocation, when it is all over, I'm seeking help with proper ways of searching for and applying for jobs in my target countries and any other guidance that you think can be useful!"

First of all, I chose Australia because 
1) I was supposed to study there for my undergrad (I already applied to a few universities) but my family did not let me push through with it.
2) I’ve been there a couple of times and really appreciate the lifestyle 
3) my dad knows a few people there in case of emergencies

However, I have NO direct relatives there at all. I would gladly take any other suggestion that would fit my situation better. I would have chosen the US, but it seems as though the current president is anti-immigrant. Plus, it takes 10 years to be a permanent resident. 

So, here’s my situation:
I’m a medical laboratory science student who will be graduating in 2021. Although my uni is one of the best for my degree, the average pay will still be extremely LOW in Manila (much less elsewhere). I’m talking 15,000PHP = 462AUD per month! It’s horrible. Aside from that, I find Manila to be quite suffocating with all the traffic and the annual alarming increase in population. And, it’s still getting worse. So I’m planning to start my career abroad sometime in the future. Though I am fully aware that it will not be easy.

Aside from the IELTS, all I know is that I have to pass the ASCP exam (the medtech license that is recognized internationally) and have 2 years of working experience. But when I do, what’s next? 

1. Do I apply for a student visa/ working visa/ other? 
2. Do I find work there first or do I have to take a few additional classes and enroll in a school?
3. How hard will it be as a non-Australian to find work? 
4. For MedTechs abroad, are you able to support yourself alone?
5. Is Australia a good country overall? Or should I plan to move elsewhere?

Thank you!

[EDIT]

I’ve read the recent news about Australian government telling immigrants to ‘go home’ so I’m kind of iffy about it at the time moment. But we’ll see in a few years. Hopefully I can get other suggestions anywhere else! Studying is an option as well for me but according to what I’ve seen, some unis don’t accept international students to study their Masters program. Perhaps they’re more lenient in European countries?

But I have already spent some months in Canada and the winter has really tired me, to the point it was affecting both my physical and mental health. I do not know if I can live there for my entire life. USA southern states have a climate that is more similar to that of Brazil. So in this situation I would study in Canada, graduate and somehow.. go to the USA? Still not sure how that would work out. I assume having a Canadian degree would make it easier to get a job there, but certainly I will not stay in Canada until I get a citizenship. I will not spend the best part of my youth where I do not want to be. So I would be a Brazilian (maybe Canadian permanent resident, maybe temporary resident), hoping that a company will sponsor a work visa in the US. Crazy plan, I know.

Plan number 2) I can go to university in Brazil. After I graduate, hope that a company will sponsor a work visa in the US. Much simpler plan, but just as risky depending on how you see things.

Pros and cons of each plan in my perspective:

Plan 1) I believe a canadian undergrad degree is much more recognized anywhere in the world than a Brazilian one. Once I graduate, salary in Canadian dollar, worth nearly 3 Brazilian reais, so I could hope to be able to pay a Master's in the US after some 3 years working full time in Canada. On the con side, this would mean living about 8 years in a place that makes me unhappy. My parents would be paying international tuition for me in my undergrad years, which is insanely expensive. I am greatly concerned that such big downsides outweigh the advantages.

Plan 2) smoother path of life, one could say? In Brazil, I will enjoy more my college years, will be near my family and friends. On the cons side, I know many Brazilians who would kill to get a work visa in the US. I would be in the same situation as they are. I am not sure if having a Canadian degree would make it significantly easier, but it is extremely hard as a Brazilian to make this move. Also, really unlikely that I will ever have the money to afford a master's in the US.

So, since this is a move that I am planning several years in advance, I would like your opinions on these matters. Do you think I am mistaken in my pro/con analysis for both plans? Am I missing or misjudging something? Does plan 1 sound too crazy? Thanks for the help"

You can schedule an appointment online through a calendar they share. It shows 3 months of dates. All unavailable. I was able to find when they update the calendar and add a week (Thursdays at midnight), but the schedule instantly indicated that the added week had no more available appointments (105 added every week).

I've seen appointments available for non visa related issues.

Are Visa related appointments closed due to the pandemic?

Are there thousands of people competing for those slots?

Are there any other options?

She is currently on a student visa (TIE) in Spain that expires June 30, 2020. She is planning on doing her masters in Germany next year. She will most likely be accepted into the program as she fulfills all the requirements and has really good grades, however the  actual acceptance letter won’t come until the end of June or mid July. 
Her original plan was to go back to the US for one or two months after her TIE expires, then come to Germany on her 90 day visa waiver, find a place to stay in the university city and then apply for a residence card. 
With the current situation, everything looks very different. Returning to the US is not really an option. The area where she is from is hit really bad by corona and it’s not looking to get better any time soon. The EU is already talking about leaving the borders to non- EU states closed until the end of September. We are worried that this could be extended even further and she wouldn’t be allowed to enter on time for university to begin. 
As soon as she is allowed to travel within Schengen, she can come stay with me. But since this massively changes the time line there are questions regarding her visa(s):

1. girlfriend has to apply to residence permit within those 90 days visa waiver. Does that have to be in the beginning so it’s processed while she’s still on her waiver or can she apply towards the end of the 90 days?

2. in order to apply to the residence permit she must be registered by the city she lives in. She needs an apartment in order to get registered. Could she register in my home town that is not near the university city (different state even) for the time being and then register in the university city later?

4. does she need to apply for a residence permit at the Ausländerbehörde in her university city or can she apply in my home town/state and then „transfer“?

5. as soon as the Spanish TIE expires she can stay in Schengen for 90 more days. If she leaves Spain and comes to Germany before the TIE expires, do the 90 days start then or only after the TIE expires?"

This is also very dependent on the COVID situation in the fall... 

Anyways, I have some logistical questions that I don't know if people will know the answers to. I don't need a student visa because of my dual citizenship, although I am confused about how this works - for example, would I just leave the US with my US passport and then go through the EU passport check when I enter the country? And if I just do that, can I just stay there or do I need to notify the US or something? In general, is there anything I know about moving to the Netherlands/abroad (besides taxes, health insurance, and bank accounts, which I am slowly figuring out)? This is my first time moving by myself, so I'm sorry if these things are obvious to some.

I will be majoring in CS, so I was wondering if anyone knows how easy it is for someone with a CS degree to get a job outside of the country they got that degree in. I'm pretty sure that it is one of the easier degrees to transfer countries with and it's probably helpful that I am female; I would prefer to move to Argentina/Chile, but even if I decide to move back to the US, is it possible to get a job in the US with a degree obtained from Holland or will they view it as lesser?"

So like the title says, I'm from the US, with only US citizenship. However I am currently living in Iceland as part of an exchange program. (I began grad school in 2018 in Sweden.) I am studying computer science and doing my thesis in robotics. I was only out of college for like a year before I went to grad school, so I have only about a year of professional experience. I did work in computing as a student, however, and have experience in high performance computing and general IT. I have undergrad degrees in computer engineering and French. After graduation I will have 2 master degrees in computer science because of my exchange program. I have a good grasp on French, however I think it would be maybe 6 months before I could actively participate in a technical work discussion or the like, since I am rusty. I had a Swedish residence permit and currently have an Icelandic residence permit (not sure if that's relevant).


**Destinations:**


I would like to live and work in the EU after graduation in June. Specifically, the countries where I would like to end up are (in order of decreasing priority): Spain, Denmark, Netherlands, France, Belgium. I've spent some small amounts of time (a few weeks) in each of these countries and would like to try living in one of them. I would prefer not to return to the US or Sweden.


**Concerns:**


I have been looking for jobs in robotics in these countries and they certainly exist, but I am wondering what my chances of getting a work permit are. I understand that a company will have to sponsor me, and I am concerned that my small level of professional experience will be a prohibitively difficult block in this case. I don't really want to stay in Iceland, even as beautiful as it is, but I understand that as someone who has completed my studies in Iceland, I will have the option to extend my residence permit for 6 months in order to seek work. This should allow me to also have Schengen travel freedom, just not Schengen work freedom. This means that I could get some temporary job in Iceland while still looking for a job in my preferred EU countries, which takes away a bit of the stress.

Currently, I just finished up the first of a two-year retraining study in Counselling/Coaching. My career aspiration is to help people finding a sense of achievement and succeed in life. I've also been lucky being accepted as a trainee at a local branch of the Clubhouse Foundation (a great institution by the way). However, future wise, I don't wish to narrow down my scope to any given sectors/branches, as long as I'm able to work in a position that include counseling and preferably cultural-related areas too.

So, the thing is that because of my domestic work market's competitiveness and limited opportunities for applicants with my background, I had to take an irrelevant job at a customer service. I've been in the job for over three years now, but started to apply for relevant (anthropology) jobs already after I graduated. Now, four years and a ton of denials later, I've never felt more hopeless in terms of finding a desired job at home. And the current pandemic isn't really making things any better quite frankly.

I realize I need to ask myself the question - how much longer am I going to accept this... Well, I guess situation or may you call it fate? It's so frustrating to go through this much resistance when I have all this motivation, competence and visions for my life. My English proficiency is really solid too relatively speaking. So, I suppose that's what recently triggered the idea of looking for work abroad instead.

I've always identified as a global-oriented guy, and as I have no ties to family or my home country, going abroad isn't a far-fetched idea. Norway is a great country in terms of employment, but the work market practices favoritism of certain educations, and offers little space for people who don't fit into the box (google the ""Jante Law"" and you'll understand). Moving abroad, there's so many questions arising - where to start, career searching, visa, housing, everyday life and so on. I am fully aware that the process of moving to a foreign country and settling down requires a lot from you, logistically and personally. But I'm pretty confident that I'll be able to make it when the right opportunities appear.

This post became longer than expected and I hope my rambling didn't cause you to fall off on the way. You see, context is part of my DNA. Anyways, I would receive all of your ideas, thoughts, advice and suggestions with great appreciation.

We are both 27. I hold a Bachelor's degree and am working on a master's (remotely), and my wife holds a Bachelor's degree in teaching (all from American universities). I have a few years' experience in marketing and supply chain mgmt, and she has a few years of teaching experience in the US.

We're interested in the express entry program, which would allow us to gain permanent residence immediately (once approved, obviously), but we would need to improve our CRS (Comprehensive Ranking System) scores a bit before we'd be realistic candidates for an invitation to apply for express entry.

If we wait until next year to submit our CRS scores, when I finish my master's, my score should jump up high enough to get us an invitation to apply for permanent residence. Having said that, given the length of the application process, that means we likely couldn't move and enter the job market until the end of 2021, or even early 2022.

That said, we believe my wife would be qualified to transfer her still-current US teaching license to a Canadian province (ideally Alberta, but we're flexible) right now. Holding a provincially-issued professional license would increase her CRS score fairly dramatically, and make it way easier for her to find a teaching job, which would also dramatically increase her CRS score.

Unfortunately... we have been told that one cannot get a provincial teaching license without first holding a work permit. But, she can't get a work permit without a job offer, and she probably can't get a job offer without already holding the license, which she can't get without a work permit. Feels like a catch-22...

Is there some way around this we're not seeing? Does anyone have any experience with getting a job offer for a K-12 teaching position in Canada before being able to transfer your teaching credentials from your home country? Is there perhaps a better route/program that we're not aware of? Or do we just need to wait a year or two for our CRS scores to go up and apply for express entry then?

I will go ahead and acknowledge that, yes, in theory, I could try to go find a job and get a temporary work permit, which might grant her an open work permit, but my undergraduate degree is in a totally different field than my work experience, and I'm not really confident that the government would sign off on any job offers to me right this second, especially given the current rise in unemployment going on. That will change after I finish my master's, and sit for a few associated certification exams, but again, that won't be for another year.

Anyway, the answer may just be that we need to settle in and wait for now, but I definitely appreciate any advice."

I am a 26 female currently residing in southeastern part of the states with my husband. I work in real estate and husband works for a global Fintech company in corporate strategy. We are young professionals with no children trying to find our place in the world. We love to travel and have been visiting different countries in Europe routinely for the last 4 years. I have fallen in love with the lifestyle and attitudes over there. It seems that on a whole, people in Europe and specifically the counties I’ve traveled to, value work life balance. The cities are beautiful, transportation is much more convenient, you have the ability to travel freely, cheaply and quickly throughout the European Union, healthcare system is very reasonable, and college tuition is subsidized. What else am i missing lol?! 

My husband is a bit of a capitalist who came from a poor, rural area in the south. He works incredibly hard and is climbing the corporate ladder to afford us the lifestyle he wants. I’m much more laid back. I don’t need much if I’m geographically located somewhere I love. He doesn’t feel moving to really anywhere in Europe is worth it (I.e major salary reduction and increase in living costs). He enjoys visiting there but truly believes USA is the best place to live. While I don’t deny that USA is a wonderful place to come from and full of opportunity (I know I am very lucky to be a citizen here and love my country), I can’t help but think it’s not the place for me personally. I am very liberal, very open to ideas like universal healthcare and even UBI. I feel like I clash severely with all my friends and family. I disagree with everything Trump and his administration stands for on a fundamental level. My home state is beginning to not feel like my home at all. I suppose We could move further north to places like NYC and I might find myself around more like minded individuals... but our country is still so incredibly divided right now. 

My question- am I crazy/naive for wanting to leave the states and move to somewhere in Europe? I would like to hear from people who actually live somewhere in Europe, especially the UK, and what their thoughts are. I’m not wanting to really dig into the logistics of the how we’d get there because it’s not worth even considering until I hear the informed opinions of those who have either made the move or have experience living in these regions (my husband also may have global opportunity in Europe with his company anyway that could help with that situation). 

And for those pro US to Europe- how the hell do I convince my dear husband (who is open minded yet slightly stubborn) that this would be a great life decision? 

This is strictly a post for information and opinions only. I’m not making any moves yet, just pondering while I self isolate :)"

I’m about to graduate from my undergrad law degree (postgrad study would be needed for me to be a practicing lawyer). My grades are quite good, my average will hopefully be a 2:1 or first, but my CV isn’t amazing so Google isn’t going to offer me a fabulous relocation package. 

I’m trying to compile a list of countries or even cities where I can work exclusively in English while I learn the language. Of course I’ll learn how to speak the local language when I know where I’m going, but that will take a while. I would love to work in a job related to my field- if I leave Europe and need a visa, I suppose I’ll have to. 

So I’m asking; 

- Does anyone have experience securing an entry level job abroad through English? How did you find the position, have you any tips? 

- Any law grads working outside of the jurisdiction they studied in? (Btw- I am aware of the process of being admitted to the bar in another EU country. I’d be open to the idea in the future, but I need a more immediate plan). 

- Is there anywhere else you would recommend to me for any other reason? Good employment prospects, particularly friendly to foreigners, good standard of living? I’m very open to opinions. 

- I would be open to working in retail or admin in a new city to learn to speak the language, but only if I can be pretty damn sure it will pay off. 

As it stands I would absolutely love to work in the Netherlands, Malta or Germany but I’m held back by only knowing English. Somewhere like Australia or America would be fantastic, and I could possibly get over on a grad visa, but I don’t know if I could get an employer/sponsor from afar. I really appreciate any advice anyone can give me, either specific recommendations or methods to narrow down my shortlist."

So, like the title says, I'm a 30 year old software engineer looking to emmigrate to Canada. Coronavirus has really highlighted the issues the US has with medicine, social safety nets and effective government in general, and I just can't see myself starting a family here. Plus you've got the possibility of a second Trump term and all the democratic backsliding that would entail.

As far as work experience, I've got about 5.5 years of software engineering experience (specifically Javascript and React) along with 6 months as a team lead. I do have a bachelor's degree, but it's in the social sciences.

My issue is basically that I was specifically looking at relocating to Montréal due to the cost of living, the cultural life (I play and release music) and the bike network/transit, but I'm just a couple points shy of a certificate of selection for the skilled worker program due to my total lack of French. I am open to another urban center like Toronto or Vancouver, since I might have a bit of a shot at being a provincial nominee, but I'd really prefer to get to Montréal. 

Do I have another option as far as Quebec goes, like being brought over on a temporary worker visa and eventually applying to stay? Another option would be acquiring some knowledge of French, but I don't know how much I could learn in a short-ish time frame. Or should I just look at another province altogether?

Thank you!"

I got an offer from a university in Ontario recently and have a week to respond. The problem now is that I can no longer afford the full tuition. It costs around 38kC$; I can afford only around 20k as tuition. Most of my resources have drained since the past few months. Is there a way I can make this work?    
Also, the program I got into is a one year Master‘s, so I would only get one year pgwp after studies. Will it be worth the risk? 

  
Sorry if this seems more like a personal finance question. The thing is, I’d also like to know if I have other options to migrate (which I don’t think is much since I only have less-than-a-year of work experience). I live in Kuwait and have no job prospects here in my field (I’ve tried for two years). Going back to my home country of India is not an option either. I had applied to universities in Canada last year too but was rejected from all. I’ve been looking forward to Canada so much, that I don’t want to give up just yet. I don’t know people who have studied and immigrated to Canada, and all the advice I can find online is to not go for grad studies if I can’t afford it. I don’t know if I should take this advice, or if I should try to leave with money I don’t have. I just have nothing to gain from living where I am right now."

Here's the catch: Lebanese banks here are basically holding our ""money"" hostage. You see, ever since October (and before that even) Lebanon has been witnessing an unprecedented economic situation. The local pound is devaluing to new records, the state announced default and banks had put restrictions on dollar withdrawal, to the point now that one can't even withdraw dollars. Fortunatley, I was able to convert all my money before October to dollars and have been withdrawing as much as I could from the bank. (I have around 8 000 usd in my apartment) Thing is, I called the bank and after heated arguments they told me that they wouldn't transfer my funds to a German bank in order to open a blocked account.

In brief- about to graduate, law student with good grades but no internships. Plenty of customer service experience, completed Erasmus, very comfortable with travel and living abroad. 

How realistic is it that I can find a job working in the Netherlands, totally through English? I’d also love to join a graduate programme, I’m searching LinkedIn for opportunities. I’m prepared to learn Dutch or any other language, but as of right now is it feasible for me to find maybe a large international company where I can get by speaking Dutch?

I am considering moving to Europe after COVID-19 is over. One of my grandparents was a citizen of a country which is now in the EU. I am eligible for citizenship by descent but the process is difficult. Just getting the documentation together would require hiring a law firm and spending thousands of euros on top of the government's fees.

As an experienced developer wanting to work in one of the big tech hubs (likely Berlin but I'm not sure yet), getting a residence permit as a non-EU citizen would not be much of an obstacle. My understanding is that foreign workers generally have equal access to things like healthcare and temporary unemployment insurance. I know that there are some benefits to EU citizenship that non-citizen residents don't have, but are those worth the high cost?

So am I missing anything? Or would going through the citizenship process be a waste?"

Hello everyone!

I'm a 3rd year student in Scotland. I chose a biology degree with the mindset ""follow what you enjoy and you'll never work a day in your life"", but I've since realised I have no idea what I want to do when I graduate. It seems many biological jobs are highly competitive and not well-paying, I wish I'd considered this before I applied for my degree.

I've been interested in Korean culture for many years, having studied Taekwon-do to black belt. I've begun learning hangeul and soon more conversational Korean. I'm fairly certain I want to leave Scotland as I want to go somewhere completely different and experience another culture. I'd also like to experience living elsewhere as I'm beginning to resent certain aspects of life in the UK and I'd like an alternate perspective.

I have no strong preference of city in Korea, although I imagine areas close to Soeul will probably have the most foreigners and opportunities. I'm also keen to learn Korean and cultural customs, so language classes, volunteering, any social activities, and martial arts would be a great help. I'm also not certain when I'd leave, but I hope to do so within the next 3-4 years depending on work or study opportunities.

I've been looking into English teaching jobs as an entrance, though I know they're dead-end; I hope to find a more long-term career. I'm also looking into postgraduate study in South Korea to see whether this could improve my job-prospects there. While I do enjoy teaching and helping others, I'd prefer a job that's more scientific or industrial, but not necessarily biology-related. I've considered academia, it's been my plan within the UK, although I'm not sure whether this is achieveable in Korea. 

Any input, advice, or experience would be greatly appreciated :)"

I was raised in Chicago for most of my life and I completed my bachelor's degree there but moved to Europe with my parents because their pension goes a long way here once exchanged. As much as I like Europe I really miss the US. I know that many members of this subreddit are US citizens looking to escape the US but I actually want to go back. Yes, healthcare, education and work-life balance is generally better across Europe compared to the US but there are some things I miss. I miss the people, way higher salaries, better entertainment, way better food, and so on. Before the pandemic hit I actually had some interviews but others have been postponed until the situation is under control. This gives me more time to think about where I would like to move to.

Now, I originally wanted to move back to Chicago but I am considering moving to other midwestern states such as Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin or Missouri. I've only been to Indiana and Missouri and I really enjoyed my stay. On top of that, cost of living seems way better compared to Illinois. My questions are: Have any US citizens applied to jobs located in the US from a different continent and actually got offers? How much did you have in savings before moving? Do you regret your decision? Also, if anyone is from these states (besides IL), would you recommend it as a place to live?

Just for more background: I have a STEM master's degree and am actively seeking career opportunities in environmental, health & safety. However, I am open to transition to another career as I apply to the career of my interest. Some programs that I I have learned during my education are R, SAS, ArcGIS, Tableau, and of course MS Office. I also have 6k saved up from my part time job while completing my studies. And, as mentioned before I have US citizenship.

I appreciate any feedback I can get!"

Hello everyone,

I have a couple of questions to ask you guys as a Turk who still lives in Turkey. I have studied journalism and graduated in 2018. In the same year, I moved to Poland to create new life. Unfortunately, things didn't go as I expect(*I waited 17 months to get my residence card, a single letter didn't come and I got sick about it*) and I moved back to Turkey.

Now I have a bit of saving but I don't know how can use the money. I interest in fixing things but in Turkey, I don't have any chance to get any education about being electrician or mechanic in Turkey because of my age(25y/o). And, I am considering registering for a trade school in Australia to be a mechanic. Now my Questions are,

Most of the schools offer part-time education like 2 days in week or weekend, and there is not enough information about programs(I think they are not popular).

\-If I apply one of the schools as I said will I able to have a work visa too or to have a work visa should I go to a ""full time"" school?

\-Being a mechanic in Australia worth investing at least 10-12K per year AUD.-Do you think can I keep alive myself while paying school fees, rent, basic expenses with minimum wage in Melbourne?

sorry for the mistakes in the language."

I understand that should I accept this offer, I would be required to get a Tier 4 visa, correct?

Facts about me 

* Worked as a legal assistant for the past few years. Looking to do something policy related, perhaps for a nonprofit or a government agency
* Would not need to take out any loans to attend
* I have American and a German passport (through descent), so visas are a non-issue for the EU and the US (yeah I know the UK isn't in the EU anymore) 

What makes this sort of unusual for me is that I'm really not that interested in (though I'm open to it if there's a good job offer) staying in the UK after graduation. I enjoyed London when I visited, but it's not my favorite place ever. I would prefer personally to return to the US or move on to continental Europe. 

I'm for the most part wondering what the experience is like for those that have gone back to their home country or moved on to another country after their education abroad. A few questions to that end 

* I understand I could attend a university in continental Europe, but my understanding is that British degrees are very well regarded in Europe and tend to be more recognized in the US, no?
* Was the networking for your education constricted to where you went to school or were there other opportunities provided? 

Many thanks."

g4vf55,[IWantOut] 25M USA -> Germany or Netherlands,1587427192.0,76,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/g4vf55/iwantout_25m_usa_germany_or_netherlands/,"TLDR: Thinking of moving to Germany because my friends live there, don't know if it's worth it. I would appreciate more input

I want to move to Germany, but I'm not sure if I'm moving for the right reasons. Basically, I did my masters in the Netherlands (as a foreign student from the US; I'm a US Citizen) and am now working for a company in the Netherlands. I made a lot of friends during my masters studies, and they were all foreign students like me. It's no secret that many foreign students leave the Netherlands after their studies to seek better opportunities in other countries, which has been sad for me as a lot of my friends already left. It got to a point where my friends were leaving the Netherlands at a rate of 1 per month, which felt like I was hemmoraging social connections. Anyways, a large group of them have moved to Germany, specifically Munich, and I find myself often going there for weekend trips, since they have frequent gatherings and outings. They are living there happily and don't have any plans to move back to the Netherlands. For me, the Flixbus fares + time spent traveling really does add up.

The reservation I have about moving is that, I heard as one ages and gets into a relationship/married, they rely less on their platonic friends for socializing. Indeed, I have never heard of someone moving to a different country to follow their friends.

Sure, there are also other reasons why I would want to move to Germany. For one, salaries in Munich are much higher than in the Netherlands. Despite the higher cost of living, my friends in Munich are still able to save more money than I can. (to buy property at some point in the future) Secondly, there are more opportunities in my field in Germany than in the Netherlands. These are valid reasons as well, and I'm also not totally satisfied with my current career situation, and don't see much room to grow within the limited job market for my field in the Netherlands. (If I was purely motivated by money though, I would move back to Silicon Valley, but I'm not)

So, in short, there is nothing tying me down to where I'm currently living. I don't have many friends and feel isolated. Dutch people are pleasant, but hard to get close to. Regardless, I have a decent life here financially speaking, and have my established routine, hobbies, and habits, so is it worth making the jump? Gut says yes, but I need a sanity check.

When I first came to the Netherlands, I had all these naive expectations about living in a liberal society with progressive values, etc, and the longer I live here, I realize that my impression as an American was totally wrong. If I were to move again, I would not have so many stereotypes and expectations, and try to keep an open mind. Learning German would be fine, since I already speak somewhat decent Dutch.

Lastly, I'm not too worried about finding a job, since my field is in demand there and my friends can refer me to their companies. I also already have work authorization in Germany (EU Blue Card), so the transition shouldn't be too painful."

I'm currently in my final year of a filmmaking degree (supposed to have graduated by now but corona and whatnot). I've always really wanted to live abroad and travel and experience other cultures and learn more and I'd like to start working on that.

I just wanted to know how I can move to one of these countries (or anywhere) and be able to work. I don't mind studying more and I don't mind changing my field of study to whatever will help me go to these places.

I've never left India and would really love to not live and work here forever.

I know some of my reasons to leave may be misplaced to some people but here are some reasons why I want to start travelling and move: I want to go to New Zealand because I'm big on the outdoors and being around nature and also I really like New Zealanders. I want to go to Italy because I love the language (kind of self-teaching myself Italian at the moment), the people, their culture, their history, and the food! I want to go to Germany because education is free there and so to me it's one of my most likely options. And they're just so good at a lot of things, in my opinion. I'd really, really love to go to the UK but it just seems so expensive. Scotland is one of my absolute favourite countries but I guess I'm just worried about how I can get there.

I am fairly handy and can pick up any skill quickly. I love learning new languages. I am currently building my web designing skills. I'm not too bad with a camera. I can write. I think I can do most things if I can train and practice it for a bit.

I'm also interested in living a sustainable lifestyle and if a good course exists somewhere then I'd really, really love to study/learn more about sustainability and the environment. And perhaps turn that into a career and help everyone and the planet. Basically any course related to nature.

What kind of work will be in demand when covid-19 dies down? Which career would be my best bet? Something that will help me go there and study or start working? How will the change in economy affect studying abroad? Will countries want more international students?

To be completely honest, I'm a little daunted by the idea of travelling anywhere because everything seems so expensive. But I want to change my mindset and and travel more.

Do let me know whatever you may know about any of these!"

I’ll be getting the degree and passing the bar next year, but I’m posting here to get some preliminary advice on what I should be doing to prepare for such a move once that happens. 

I won’t get specific as to which state I live in, but it isn’t one of the major ones with international connections like NY or CA. I’m pretty curious about living in other countries, have spent some time abroad, and have always wanted to live somewhere else that isn’t the USA. I’m deciding Canada as my destination, either somewhere near the Great Lakes or in Nova Scotia. It is close enough to my family’s home area (as opposed to somewhere like Ireland or New Zealand) while having some new elements that I think I’ll enjoy living with. Besides, I like the cold, poutine, maple syrup, hockey, the great outdoors, all that. (Stereotypical, but I've been told that's 90% true by Canadians.)

I’m currently a law student that will be finishing up my J.D. in the coming year, and I hope to pass my state bar exam (it is a UBE state). I was a bit of a college-to-law-school person, as I knew what kind of work I wanted to go into -- although I will admit the practice of law was much bigger than I anticipated and I don’t have a definite idea as to what I will specialize in just yet. (Probably civil as opposed to criminal, and government work might be an eventual area I go into.)

So far, the research I’ve done tells me that I’ll need to apply for certification with the NCA as a foreign lawyer - take all the tests and such. After that, I'd need to apply to the specific province's law society and take that exam. I did hear about articling as a thing I would have to do, but I didn't look too much into that.

What I don't know -- and what I hope you can help fill in -- is how someone like me would be able to make it in Canada. It would be ideal if I could just get my degree and hop on over to get certified in Canada and find a job, but it probably isn't as easy as that. My other option would be to get in my state bar, work for a few years, and then try making the move north. What sort of problems do you think I might run into in either plan, and what preparations can I be making now to make the move more efficient when the time comes?

Thank you for your time! Feel free to ask any clarifying questions, I'll try to answer the best I can."

Living abroad has been my dream for such a long time now, but I've always pushed it aside as it is a bit of a risk and all of my family lives here. I am really content with where I live, but I am a bit nervous about my country and state's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and I want to do something else with my life than stay in the same place forever.

Safety is also pretty important to me.

Housing is pretty cheap as well as school, so that would be a huge plus! I am also pretty familiar with the exams needed to enter into the university I would go to.

France and Germany are tied as they have fantastic schooling for both IT and international business, but the cost of living in both countries is high, and I don't know how easy it would be to find a job given my experience.

I am about to graduate from university with a degree in Civil Engineering. I am interested in (eventually) moving abroad to start/continue my career (provided whenever the COVID crisis winds down). I am interested in New Zealand and Canada because they are English-speaking and seem like places I would enjoy living. I was wondering if anyone had experience moving to these countries to work and could answer some questions I had about searching for a job and getting the appropriate visas.

I do know that this is all contingent on how the COVID situation pans out, but I wanted to do some research since I have some more time and can make more thoughtful decisions about my career.

1. How likely is it that an entry-level or lower-level engineer can find work abroad? I know it's possible but I find that applying for international positions gets me screened out because I'm not a citizen of those countries and would require sponsorship if hired. Is there a way to work around this, or are there instances where I could get hired as an international person?
2. In terms of the job search, does it help to move to the country first and apply for engineering positions and hope that I can then get sponsorship? I know in NZ there is a working holiday visa, but I have seen that on that visa, which only lasts for a year, you can only work for 6 months of it. Is it possible to use that 6 months working for or finding an engineering company, and could that turn into a full-time offer and thus a change in my visa status? In Canada, what are my options?
3. How is the work-life balance and the culture in these countries? Part of why I want to move abroad is that I don't like how work-centric it is in the USA, and I am also very concerned about how healthcare is abhorrently expensive. The way the USA has been handling the COVID pandemic on a national level has been terrible, and the way our leadership has been behaving and acting throughout the past few years has been embarrassing and worrying. I know moving to other countries brings its own problems and things I might not be happy about, but I would like to hear some of the good/bad things about the culture and how life is like in NZ and Canada.
4. Are there any other places I'm missing that would be good places to consider, especially as a young engineer? It's convenient that NZ and Canada are mainly English-speaking, but I am learning French and German and am more than willing to take intensive courses to move somewhere non-English speaking to work. If I were to consider moving somewhere else (I'm mostly considering the EU if not NZ or Canada), I would want there to be a way to get a job as a young engineer as opposed to waiting a longer time to get PE licensure in the USA and then moving overseas (unless that is the only option).

About me: I have 1.5 years of ""co-op"" experience (co-ops are longer internships (6-8 months at a time) that are almost treated like entry-level positions) in the civil engineering industry, focused in water and environmental engineering. I have experience with different drafting, mapping, and water modelling programs and am more than willing to learn more. My university curriculum taught both the metric system and the US system of units, so it won't be a huge shock to me to switch to metric. I have passed my Fundamentals of Engineering exam, which is a test in the USA that gives you ""Engineer-in-Training"" certification to start your career towards a Professional Engineering license.

I have a high school degree and I did an apprenticeship as a Funeral Director. But at the moment I am working as the manager of a nice Coffee/Bar/Bistro in my hometown and I'm also organizing events and concerts there.
Although I love it here, I am sick and tired of my co-workers and my boss (MILF of 2 kids, married to an golf instructor), who is a great and kind human being but a terrible business person. She doesn't give me the ""power"" I should have as her manger (long story)  and I just feel stuck somehow. I'm also kind of afraid of going back to undertaker business, since I had a hard time during my apprenticeship in the funeral home...
Also I feel that Germany, especially Bavaria are to conservative for me...to narrow minded.
I'm into Art's and crafts, I am great with people, have a lot of working experience, and I love weed.
So yesterday I thought...why not apply to the Oaksterdam University, learning everything you need to know about growing and stuff, start my own business and have a new life, far away from here. Or work at a funeral home in the States, and help people there through these hard times...
And today I remembered that there is this Lottery, so I went on their website,sent my application and paid for the confirmation fee... and not two hours later a get a call from a very nice lady...
I am a high class candidate for the Green Card, they say. She was eager to get everything set for me, so she can send me all the paperwork and asked told me, it would cost around 1,300$ for the process, since it's a lot of stuff and they want to assist me as much as possible... sound's fair to me honestly. She gave me time until tomorrow morning, since I  wanted to think about it first.
Problem is, due to Corona my working place is closed until further notice and I also thought about applying for a new job and build up some savings. I don't have that much money, my Bank offered me a small credit recently, around 1300€, from my credit card which I never use. I also get a part of my sallary from sick notes, which is only around 1000€ and I have a savings account with 500€. :'D Im am sure that I could get some help from my family but the big question ist:
Should I???
I mean, it will take a while until the borders will be open again and this whole mess is over. But I still don't know, if it's the right time for such big dessions.
Should I try to make this work or shall I wait until next year maybe?? Help me quick please!!
Im overwhelmed with the situation.

Tldr: i spontaneously applied for the Green Card lottery because I want to go to Oaksterdam University and got called back almost immediately. I don't really have the money for the process fee, so what do??"

Pre-recs alone will take 1.5-2 years so that on top of nursing school itself, this is a long process.

I'll go anywhere and Im willing to learn a language and start now- I am already an Arabic student, so I have the basic skills to pick up languages.

I don't care where I go, I just want it to be somewhere that takes care of its citizens. A place my kids will be raised to care about the world beyond their own borders. Canada is on my mind, my friends and ex partner live there and I admire how they've described their countries general reaction to the pandemic and how it overall takes care of its people. Plus, its diversity (in the cities) but I am open to anywhere.

I have a trillion reasons for wanting to become an RN, ones that having nothing to do with moving, but a nice bonus is the fact that its probably easier to immigrate as a nurse than it is many other professions. So countries where nursing is needed is a big plus.

&#x200B;

\*Note added: The only other path I am strongly considering is Law school however, I dont think it would be very easy to move around with a JD, even between U.S states. Been torn between the for a few years now, but the ability to move is what seems to be tipping me towards nursing.

What are some counties to focus on right now, so I can start doing my research/language learning?"

I'd probably have to rent for a couple years. I'm willing to pay somewhere up to $1000 a month (per person for 3-4 bedrooms) prefer something cheaper of course but I also want to be realistic. Boston is expense af so if rent destroys my bank account ill be emotionally prepared.

&#x200B;

**Required:**

* A reasonably sized apartment/place to live, doesn't have to be nice, just cant be claustrophobic.
* Somewhere with a lot of people around my age, a decent nightlife, etc. So probably a city, or super close to one.
* I don't want to live somewhere too crowded. Somewhere like LA seems overwhelming, need some kind of balance/breathing room. Definitely wouldn't mind a smaller/medium sized city.
* Relatively warm, don't mind if winters get a bit chilly but I'm done with fucking blizzards.

&#x200B;

**Preferred/not required**

* I love the mountains. Would be nice to live near/up in the mountains
* like the beach, but don't love it. Being somewhere with a 1-2 hour drive to the beach would be cool but don't want it to get in the way of any of the above.
* I like trees. Trees are cool man. (Actual trees, not marijuana. Although i like marijuana too)

&#x200B;

**A little more info about me -**

* Love video games/esports/music/hiking
* sports are cool, but I'm not a die hard fan. I can fit in with sports fans if I need to but I wouldn't say its my crowd.
* I'm not a skier
* I have a car bur would be willing to ditch it for public transportation if needed

&#x200B;

Not sure how realistic im being here but would love to hear some suggestions for people who live/have lived out there! A few states on my mind are California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and *maybe* Oregon.

Edit: Probably obvious but this would be post-covid chaos lol.

**The city I want to go to the most is Boston, followed by New York. (Australia and Canada are only alternatives if I fail to get US visa)**

# ABOUT ME

* Freelance graphic designer since 2012 (7 years)
* Went to art school in 2017 to get a Multimedia Design degree and make expatriating easier
* Now focusing on UI/UX, I read this track is set to grow more than other design fields in the future

# CRITERIA

**1.** **Salary, I am a breadwinner and need to send money back home** \- I tried to compare (A) lower salary + lower living cost vs. (B) higher salary + higher living cost, and (B) always wins. I am not a lavish person and I never go out (introvert) so the rent is the most I'd spend on. I can also follow a budget.

    Top Three: 1. New York 2. Boston 3. Los Angeles

**2. My friends**\- My best friend of 10 years migrated to Sudbury, Massachusetts last year, and I have another close friend working as a nurse in Edmonton. (They were able to migrate because their mom/partner works/lives there.)

I dream to take my masters in the future, so if I can get a job in a university in Boston, plus the fact that my best friend also lives there, I would probably die happy.

    Top Two: 1. Boston 2. Alberta

**3. Getting around** \- I am sure I won't afford a car especially on the first months, plus it would be nice to be visited by my family or go home without burning all my savings. For this reason I am seriously considering Australia too.

    Top Three: 1. Melbourne 2. Alberta 3. Boston/New York

# QUESTIONS

1. *How can I get to US if designers are not on their skill shortage list (I cannot find a list)? I cannot get there w/o a job offer, but I can't apply if I am not there? I'm on a loop.*
2. *Will my 8-year freelancing career matter to employers or would I be stuck with a fresh graduate stamp on my forehead? I am set to graduate 2021.*
3. *I really want to go to Massachusetts or New York, but given my slim chances, would Australia or Canada be a better alternative?*  
4. *While I am purely Filipina, my grandfather was half-Chinese, and I look Asian, as in, big time. Hopefully COVID-19 is over next year, but in the likely case it isn't, would my Asian origin affect my chances to secure a job, or quality of life in the US?*

I've been researching working abroad for the past five years, but no one to ask if I am being unrealistic or I'm looking at the wrong places. The two friends I know had relatives there, which I don't. Any advice or connection is a gold mine to me. Thank you all."

1.  I think there is going to be a very long time with a bad economy, so I would need the place to be cheap to live.  Preferably rent for a 3 bedroom around $800 or so with hot showers and internet, somewhat close to a beach would be really nice.

2. I would also like somewhere that I might be able to invest some money and have some possibility of an upswing later.  (in the US where I am, there is not much upside right now, but lots of downturns possible)  I do understand that laws are different in every country so I would have to talk with a lawyer, but just a guess of what I could do would help.  I am thinking that it would have to be something catering to foreigners because the locals won't be able to afford as much as the tourists would.  

3. I would like a place that would allow dual citizenship with the US.  My family and I don't like to feel helpless, and we are thinking a dual citizenship would at least give us more options.  (I know it doesn't solve everything, but every little bit helps)

4. We are open to learning a new langue, but currently only know English.

5. We are ok with not being too close to other ex-pats.

I’ve long craved an exit with no real plan in place. 
I’ve just reached a point where I can’t (don’t want to) take the weather, overcrowding and endless list of frustration caused by being here.

I’ve been self-employed forever and not hugely looking to be employed.
I have an existing consultancy business and can work from more or less anywhere there’s WiFi.
The more time I’ve spent in the US / Canada, the more I like it and I always hoped that to be my destination. However I can’t just turn up and ask to live there and I’m not going to have an employer to sponsor me so no visa via that route.
With Brexit happening I can’t just up and move to Europe either now.
South Africa appeals but again I can’t just go and walk in. And if I bought a house they might just come take it off me again.

Right now I’m looking for facts on frankly any countries I can go live in without needing to be a citizen, married to one or bringing a huge pile of money. I have some savings of course, but for example I can’t spend US$1 million to buy a Green Card.

I’m contemplating digital nomad-ing for a while but I’m not exactly young and I’d like to have a plan to settle somewhere that wasn’t here, eventually. I appreciate I can bounce around for 90-180 days between countries but I’d like to be somewhere for a timeframe in years, legally.

Languages: I’m willing to learn. I don’t want to be the Brit who just assumes people speak English. Ask for help but make some effort to at least be able to communicate in whatever it is the locals speak.
Heritage: British as it gets. No foreign parents or grandparents to get a foot in the door of another country.

I fear this could be a short list of candidate countries but thanks in advance..."

g3hjf7,[IWantOut] 32m Software engineer Netherlands ->US/UK/Canada,1587212912.0,145,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/g3hjf7/iwantout_32m_software_engineer_netherlands/,"I am a software engineer with few years of experience. I have a Masters degree in computer science.

For your recommendations you can mention a specific city if you want.

Here is my criteria

1. High salary/high savings for software engineers, atleast equal to or higher than the Netherlands. US wins here by a mile. London is a distant second. Canada loses points here. While I have heard that the cost of living is higher in the US people can also save a lot more money than in europe. I would consider London in between US and Canada in terms of salaries. Although I am not sure which one between these is better for savings. I would think the salaries and savings are higher in London.
I think both US and London are a step up from the Netherlands in terms of salary and savings. I think Canada is a major step down. People make way less money and things are more expensive.

2. Tolerant to muslims/people of color.(London and Canada win here. US loses major points here). Honestly what I have heard about the US it scares me. I have read about a muslim who was completely innocent but was picked up from his home and tortured for several years and then deported. I dont want to end up like one of those statistics. 

3. Job security: I think there isnt much job security in the countries I mentioned. Atleast not high as the Netherlands. But I want your opinions on this as well.

4. Healthcare: London and Canada have either free healthcare or its covered by insurance. I just read that you can end up in debt in the US if you end up in ER. A doctor visit is 200 dollars thats crazy!

5. Easy to travel to Europe/Netherlands: London wins here. If I want to travel to Netherlands or some other place in europe I can do so in a few hours. With US and Canada it will be a whole lot difficult. Especially cause they are further away from europe and have even less holidays.

6. No weird weather phenomenon like tornadoes, volcanoes, cyclones, earthquakes

Here is my current ranking based on my personal knowledge of these countries. This could change as I get more information.

1. London best fits my criteria currently. You can make a high salary, its tolerant to everyone and accepting of everyone. It is a step above for the salary in the Netherlands. It has most of the same healthcare, vacation time as other european countries. Its closer to the rest of europe so I can go to Netherlands or other countries easily if I want. Downsides are its incredibly expensive and I may not save any money here. Also its not a place to live long term due to how expensive it is.

2. US is second because it offers the highest salaries worldwide. I can save the most money here and probably buy a house when I come back. The downsides are that its racist to muslims. Like I mentioned earlier I am sometimes afraid of going there and be abducted by some agent or something. During my research I came across several news items where they abducted many educated muslims in the bush era and tortured them without proof.  Bad/expensive healthcare is another drawback. i just read that you can run debt for visit to ER. Gun laws/shootings and crime.  No job security. Hard to get a work permit. Far away from europe and the rest of the world. 

3. Canada. I like Canada so much. I really like the things that I hear about it. They treat immigrants so nicely and there is very little racism there compared to the other countries I mentioned. The downsides to Canada are that the salaries are incredibly low and things are more expensive. I had thought about moving to Ontario but it looks like a major step down from the Netherlands. Also I dislike the freezing cold weather. Just like the US its also far away from the rest of europe. But if saving money wasnt an issue this would probably be tied with London.

If Canada had salaries comparable to the Netherlands and if it was near Europe it would be a clear winner. But since it would be a step down from the Netherlands I am hesitant to accept it.

**I just found out that salaries in Canada are higher than Europe. So my information was wrong? In that case I better move to Canada since it covers most of my criteria https://www.codementor.io/blog/best-cities-software-engineer-earnings-271vpf599k**


**Edit: Some people are saying that US and Canada are completely different based on the city. I realize that and I would request you to reccomend a city that most closely matches the three criteria I mentioned.**

**Edit2: Slightly reworded my post and added some more details since everyone is only focusing on the US and only on point 1. Also no one is talking about the health insurance costs.**"

The problem is my spouse's grandmother was supposedly born in Belfast during the early 1920s and we can't find records of her birth.

I'm a 28 year old engineer currently working in the aerospace industry in the UK as a Systems Architect and have worked at some of the big UK engineering companies over the last 7 years, I have a Masters degree in Aerospace Engineer and am chartered. 

I am looking to move to the US for the next 3-5 years, mainly as the pay is better for engineers out there and it might aid career development. At this point in my life, I think I can live without the extra holiday time/some of the other benefits we get here in the UK. The issue I am having is finding jobs at companies that will sponsor a work visa or are even open to non-Americans. While I can code (C/Python), I am not looking at jobs involving heavy programming as I have done these in the past and can't get past the drudgery.

Moving internally within my company to other countries is pretty good, except to the US...the American side of the business seems to be ring fenced making it difficult to get in.

In terms of savings, I have about reasonable amount saved up and a flat in London I am currently paying the mortgage on, but could re-mortgage to allow me to rent out while I am away. 

The other option is to sell the flat and use anything I get from it and savings to do an MBA in America and see if I can move into consulting.

What do you guys suggest as the best way to move forward? Are there other industries I could look at?"

I’ve been wanting to move out of the US and to Scotland for a few years now and have done so much research over the months and get more and more discouraged the more I read. I know it’s not easy, very difficult actually, moving always is, but people make it seem impossible. 

Some people say it’s basically impossible to zero chance to go from a tier 4 to tier 2 and find a sponsor and to not even bother, but then others say as long as you apply early enough you’ll definitely find a job after graduating and be okay. It might be because I noticed the pessimistic answers were more from before they’ve recently changed it where you have two years now to find a sponsor/job instead of the few months like it was before last September. So maybe it will be a bit easier now? So that’s one good thing maybe. Also I think I read that the resident labour market test isn’t necessary if you are tier 4 switching to tier 2, so that’s another good thing at least, though I know there’s still a cost for them to sponsor me. Is it ok to inform in my CV/cover letter that I’m ok to take these charges personally when applying to jobs to increase my chances? 

I wanted to go to school for all four years for my bachelor in Scotland but now I’m wondering if I should get my bachelors here (don’t really want to) and then maybe get my masters there and try to find a job then? Idk which would be better or what potential employers there would prefer. I want to go for tech so like IT, or software dev or software engineer, I don’t know yet. 

I really want to leave the US for multiple reasons (get away from terrible family, shitty corrupt govt, idiocracy becoming more real, sky high uni and healthcare costs, etc etc) more and more each year but I get more scared to make this huge leap the more negative scary things I read- I don’t want to spend all this money on a degree there and then be forced to come back only for no one wanting to hire me here either because I have a foreign degree from a university they’ve never heard of and know nothing about. I don’t know what to do or who to believe when I keep seeing contradicting answers. I don’t want to give up but it’s getting closer and closer to that point and I feel stuck here. I understand they can’t make it easy, otherwise everyone would move there, but am I thinking all this over for nothing?"

I was wondering if anyone knows if this can be done online or do I have to go to an embassy in person? The nearest Italian consulate to me is about 400 miles away so I'm hoping this process can be done remotely. Especially considering the fact that most embassies are closed due to the current pandemic.
* I am also curious about health care. This might sound like a dumb question so please excuse my ignorance in advance, but I was wondering if I will have to obtain healthcare from a different provider when I'm abroad? And if so are universities capable of sponsoring health care in Italy (as is the case with universities in America) or is my best bet to look for at an external group like Cigna or Aetna? 
* Another topic I'm fuzzy on in is working on a student visa. I know that an Italian student visa allows the holder to work up to 20 hours a week. I was wondering how feasible is it for an American to get a part-time job on a student Visa is. I currently don't speak any Italian and don't need to for my program (however, ill need to demonstrate basic comprehension of the language in order to graduate), but I'm unsure of what jobs I could receive only speaking English. I certainly intend to learn the language and hopefully become fluent during my studies but getting a part-time job off the bat seems intimidating. Does this seem like a possibility or are there no part-time jobs a student can get that do not require Italian? 

That's about all I can think of for now. But, rest assured my late-night panicked googling will definitely yield more questions for me to ask so I'll probably post again later. If you've read this far thank you so much and if you could answer or any or all of my questions I would certainly appreciate it.

Given the future revolution and massive strikes that will take place in   France after the containment, I am looking for a country that will accept future french immigrants.

To   be more precise, I am looking for a country that doesn't have a    ""protest culture"" and that doesn't think that the more we mess up our country,  the more rights we will get. Switzerland seems like an antithesis of  France.

I am an EU  citizen so it seems that I can work in Switzerland.  I want to work as a  Software Engineer. The problem is that I don't know any german. I don't think I am ready to learn another language at my age and learning german seems only the first step to understand swiss german. ( and it  seems that ""swiss german"" is not uniform ).

However,  it seems that most IT jobs are in the german part of the country. Can someone tell me more about the swiss IT sector ? Is there many jobs in the french part of the country ? In Geneva or Lausanne ? Is english more common in IT jobs ? Is it much more competitive than in the rest of the  EU ?

Thanks in advance."

Mainly through education, I want to apply to a master's degree, hopefully in mathematics. However, I'm not sure if that is allowed in Germany I've checked out some programs and it seems like that if you want to go into mathematics, they only accept students with bachelors in mathematics. Since, that isn't possible then I'd be fine applying to CS programs with a strong focus on mathematics. CS already has a lot of math, I guess, but there are fields like HPC and Scientific Computing that focus more on math. Quite frankly, I want to apply whatever I learn into finance. 

I don't know German, I want to learn next year, I know there are English programs out there, even so learning German has always been one of my goals. Learning while I study seems like a good way to do that. 

The university that stands out the most to me was TUM, their MSc in CS was pretty great, and math focused. However, I made the conversion from my country's grading system to the German system, it says I have a 2.4, I'm pretty sure that's good, but not stellar, I don't know if you need to be ""stellar"" to get into TUM, seems like an equivalent to MIT, Stanford, Berkeley.

Other than that, I'm completely lost on what to be on what to look for.  

I was hoping someone could help me out with finding what I'm looking for. I'm not at all familiar with the German system, aside from what I mentioned above. 

Thanks in advance."

As of this month, I'm finally done my Bachelor's degree (it took me a while because I switched into a really difficult double major, and I spent this last year as an executive in my Students' Union, way more job than school). I grew up in a town of 7000, and came here for school, in a city of 100,000. I don't deny that this place took me from a small town boy to a man, I have very precious memories from here, but it's also harbouring a lot of pain. This past year has sent a landslide of garbage at me and it's just not letting up. I love my friends that I've made here, but I'm also feeling an association of pain with this city in general. 

I do currently live in Canada, I have travel experience, but only on this continent, I've visited nearly every western state and province, as well as a vacation to Mexico (doesn't really count lol). I'm considering a big move, but need your advice. I've considered a bunch of options, such as Victoria, Ottawa or Montreal (I know, not leaving the country then) but also the United Kingdom and French speaking countries. 

I am Canadian by birth, and I'm fairly positive I am a British citizen by descent since my mother is British. My degree is in Mathematics and Economics, and I've always wanted to learn French. That being said, most of my knowledge is in reading, and that's still fairly basic. Trying to converse in French is still very challenging. I was hoping maybe that moving to a French country could force me to learn. I do recognize this is stressful and could just be worse. It doesn't have to be a permanent move either, just an amount of time to experience something new. I currently also work in the field of disability service, and I understand first aid, bartending, C++, policy, politics, and some music production. I recognize the COVID-19 situation and have no intention of leaving until this has calmed down significantly. 

I also recognize that maybe I'm wanting to leave for the wrong reasons, maybe I'm crazy for going to a French country with so little knowledge of the language, and maybe my degree is better fit here in Canada. Anything you know can help me, it's okay to suggest something completely different than what I mentioned, it's okay to tell me I'm approaching this wrong, I'm just hoping for something constructive.

As much as I love this country and its government and people, I've realized I feel like I'm wasting my life here. I currently live in the South Island of NZ in a semi-rural area, and I'm well fed-up with feeling isolated from the rest of the world. I lived in Christchurch for a little while, but since the quakes it's pretty stagnant. Also lived in London for a year and I loved it, but had to come home so I could afford to sort my health out.

I don't have a degree but it's on my agenda once I figure out what I want to study. I want to study abroad for a couple years and then decide from there if I want come back to NZ to settle down or stay overseas. My work experience is limited to retail and hospitality but I'll do just about anything. I've got a hair over $10,000 saved up right now and once the lockdown is over and it's safe/I'm ready to jump ship, I should have around $15,000. 

My *ideal* destination would include:
* Good public healthcare. I have meds that I'll need to take for the rest of my life and it's likely I'll need surgery in the somewhat distant future.
* Relatively low cost of living. That said, there's a housing crisis in NZ and I paid $3 for a single pathetic tomato at the supermarket yesterday, so my definition of low-cost may be different.
* Long, warm summers and preferably mildly cold winters, though I don't mind harsh winters. I like being able to swim or hike most days from late spring to early autumn.
* Somewhere within a couple hours from a big (or biggish) city but not far from nature. Forests, beaches, lakes, mountains. I don't really mind. I break horses in as a side-gig and I'd like to live somewhere close to cheap farmland so I can take this up again in the future.
* A vibrant culture and interesting history. I love museums and theatre and music. I like being able to spend a day walking through a city and just stumbling into cool little areas. I don't care much about nightlife though.

London ticked some of those boxes for me but was inevitably too expensive for me to sustain living there, since I have no formal qualifications. I also struggled to find a longterm group of friends my age there -- I'm guessing this would be easier if I went to uni. The smog also got to me after a while.

I'd consider moving to another city in NZ but the downside is travelling overseas is ridiculously expensive. My other ideas were Canada, the UK or somewhere in western Europe. I have a British passport so the UK is the simplest option, and it allows for easy travelling to Europe. France (specifically the south) is appealing but I may be heavily romanticizing it. Sweden and Norway seem to be great when it comes to public infrastructure, healthcare etc but I'm not sure about the climate. Ireland also fits the bill in a lot of ways, but again, I don't think I could handle gloomy grey weather for most of the year. 

I'd appreciate any ideas or advice about where I should look onto. It's going to be a while before I can travel anyway so I've got plenty of time to research."

I am a Biomedical Technician with bio-engineering skills. Biomedical Technicians repair medical equipment, Biomedical Engineers do science/research. I have my Bachelors of Engineering in Biomedical Engineering (with a concentration in MechE) and have worked in research labs for about two years. My official job title is Specialist Engineer, where I not only repair equipment but employ engineering management strategies (asset deployment, capital management, so forth). I make about $100k per year and have about $50k saved up (spread between $40k liquid, $10k assets + investments). No debt. My girlfriend is a teacher and is also in no debt (she's the best).

I like the USA because I feel a connection to my home. However the USA stresses me out. When I see countries with higher social reforms in terms of healthcare or UBI, it makes me realize that I am just stuck in an existential struggle. I am currently working in a hospital during this COVID-19 crisis. Some of the visiting EMT's just can not afford insurance, and do not have it. I love the United States, but I feel like I'm just walking on a tight rope. One slip and I am going to fall and not get up. I am very against how backwards my country is, socially. I mean, I can afford these things because of my financial position. But between inflationary indices and worrying about accidents I may have in the future - I would much prefer to be somewhere where I can feel relaxed knowing that I'd live in a country with fiscal policies in place to favor its citizens. I just feel that there's so much effort concentrated to loving working 40 hours for someone and it's ridiculous to me to prefer working over living your own life. I mean, if you love your career, different story. But to just be expected to make your career your life is just toxic to me, and that's all the USA runs on to me - throwing yourself into capitalism as if your life has no meaning outside of work.

Seeing my cohorts have to take out an arm and a leg to go into student debt to end up having to fight, PPE and gowns in hand, to keep people alive during a pandemic, and hearing comments such as ""the cure can't be worse than the virus"" just really makes me realize that I have the ability to just not be here. I've educated myself enough to be useful in other places. Why am I supposed to want to die for the DOW? Why should I be here, of all places? Why do I WANT to be here, of all places?

But then, where do I even go?

That being asked, my dream requirements I guess are English speaking but not strict on it, pro-UBI/Healthcare, low cost of living, and most importantly biomedical engineering/bioengineering job friendly. I can do a masters in Cardiac Perfusion, Mechanical Engineering, or get an RN equivalent if my background is shit. I can also get more money because work and I'm fiscally responsible. I think I'm just asking too much and am tired of everything going on and won't be surprised if this is a tough post to answer. tyia"

I really wanna make this super-short and readable for as many people as I can. You can skip some parts and still get the whole story.

I hope you're all hanging in there tight during this COVID-19 crisis! So, here's my story, in the most ""dudely"" written way:

# Personals & Qualifications:

**Ever been to abroad?**: Hell yeah. Exchange program in EU during bachelors, multiple vacations and pretty much everywhere I had the ticket to go, 12 countries so far.

**BSc** Degree in Systems Engineering at one of the top 3 universities in Turkey.  
**MA** Degree in Information Management at another one of the top 3 universities in Turkey.

**Work experience:** 2 years, full-time at a major scale multinational company, specializing in data and analytics, associate level. The ""talent swap"" program is basically not functional, we can say that there is no such opportunity.

**Applying** to random jobs through digital platforms: This does not work since I do not have a residence or work permit.

**Also** applying for a Doctorate's/Ph.D. Degree: Unfortunately, this does not work either, since the fees are enormous and I have very limited financial resources. Since I am not an EU/USA citizen or anything like that, the fees for me are sometimes 6-7 times more expensive and I simply cannot afford that. 90% of the scholarships are not applicable to me, because of the same reason.

**Why** EU, CAN, USA? : The only foreign language that I'm super comfortable in is English, which would totally work for all of the ones here. I could learn a new local language if there was an option in the EU.

Well, so that is me. During this whole #StayAtHome thing, I thought maybe I could get some of you guys' knowledge and advice. I do not know any idea on how to break this loop and find a solution, all doors seem closed. I'd appreciate all the comments and guidance that you share, thanks a lot!

No, really, like, really thanks a lot, I truly cannot find a way to get out of here, I genuinely need some help. Thank you.

# (Optional) Brief Reasoning:

*Life here is really hard. Like, really hard.*

*Dear people in the 1st world countries like in the USA, CAN, or the EU, I have seen some serious shit in my 25-year life, probably more shit than you can ever see in your entire life.*

*The people, the culture, the customs, the economy, the mentality, the politics, the future, the past, the present, the ""everything""... It's all so wrong, so, so wrong.*  
*I've made my mind to leave the country when I was just a teenager but I always felt like those were temporary feelings, so I moved on here. However, now I am 100% sure that there is no happy ending scenario for the next 30-40 years. So I really need to make a move while I am still young and healthy. I am single now and in the future, if I ever become a father, I do not want my kids suffering here as I have.*"

Hello reddit, 

Since I can remember, I have been fascinated with America and its inhabitants. Using the power of the internet I have met many great friends from across the states. From a young age, I knew I wanted to visit California. This then went on to the possibility of moving there. 

Firstly, I have not been to USA. I will defiantly visit at least once before a final decision (visit next year possibly). Admittedly I have not properly researched into it as until now, having been a distant dream. I would love to think that I could actually achieve this goal. Before, I get all excited and start packing I would like some past experiences and tips. My main question being, is it do-able? 

I currently have some savings, not a lot but it’s a start. My job pays a good income even though I am currently still in training, which I have nearly finished. The job I do is work as an electrical fitter on the electricity network. Just for added information, the parent company is American however, not California. I have looked into work over there and I would hope to be doing the same thing. From my research, I found that a lot of the power distribution in California are owned by the metropolitan/ council? How hard would it be to get this kind of job?

I currently do not own a home however; I am saving up. Ideally this could all go to moving to USA or buying a house in the UK in which I can rent to keep a cash flow whilst I would get on my feet. 

To finalise some of my main concerns are: getting a job once I am there, Places in California that are recommended (including for next year’s holiday) and overall, how likely this let’s say dream for now is. Hopefully, I can make this dream become a reality!

I'm very sick and tired of living in this country as well as the fact I can't get along with most people in higher positions due to the fact that everything goes against the law in here making me lose many job/education opportunities because I was unlucky in the fact that I was competing against people who have connections. 

I was thinking of studying in Germany to get a second major or get my master's in materials science so I can then find a job and try to settle in.

How difficult is it to find a job in Germany for a person with a master's in materials science?  what kind of degrees/majors work well in Germany for an immigrant?"

My Father was born in Italy in 1954.  He moved to Canada in 1959. Naturalized Canadian. Gave up his Italian citizenship in 1972 (was called to the Italian army and didn't want to go.) His parents, and everyone before them are Italian.

As far as I've read, I cannot get citizenship to either Italy or Germany... but I'm wondering if there are any loopholes or rules I'm not sure of. Does anyone have experience with this?  Would my father or mother be able to get their citizenship back?

Since it is nearly impossible to get a citizenship/visa for other countries my first plan was to make a carrier in IT (hold a diploma in computer science, graduated 2007), find an employer which has offices in USA/Japan/Australia. The part with the carrier did work somehow (managed to become Head of software development), but in companies which only operate locally and resulted in two burnouts. For this reason I'd prefer to change profession, but to be realistic thats no option for emigration at this stage in my live. I founded my own company (IT-Consulting/Development) last year, with the plan to be independent of the office and can at least work away from Germany, which was not the best idea since I suck at customer acquisition. 

The reason for these countries are different:

\- USA/Australia: I speak English fluently and they have regions with nice weather and long days (I HATE WINTER!!!!)  
\- Japan: I'm a huge fan of the culture/people (not only manga/animes!). Unfortunately I'm at best beginner level in Japanese (learning)

I looked into getting a visa for each country, but when I understood correctly the only solution for me would be to find an employer first. For the USA I have tried at several companies, but not even a response. 

Do you see another way to get a permanent/working visa? (Would be nice if it didn't take 7-10 years)  
Any recommendations for finding an employer who does like to go through the trouble of the visa process?"

I have a question about the money aspect of the non-lucrative visa. From what I understand for one person you need ~30,000 USD per person per year for the non lucrative visa for Spain. And it doubles if you have two people to around ~$66,000 USD. Do you have to have all this money saved, or is close to this + showing you have income every month enough? I know you can not work on this visa. We are planning on having rental income.

As I understand, the next time you renew, you pretty much have to show you have 140,000 USD since you are renewing for two years. Is this right? They want you to have that much money saved to prove you can provide for yourself for two years? Are there cases where people get approved for having just under this but proving they have income to sustain themselves indefinitely?"
g1i9ov,[IWantOut] 18M USA -> Anywhere,1586942545.0,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/g1i9ov/iwantout_18m_usa_anywhere/,"**My situation:** I'm currently enrolled at a community college where I am getting my general education out of the way. I have yet to pick a major, and have almost no direction in my life. I want to set goal(s) for myself in terms of career prospects and potential new countries to live in.I don't yet have a set place in mind, as I'm still doing research on different countries. I've looked into Sweden and Canada so far, in terms of actual in depth information related to immigrating/job markets, etc.

&#x200B;

Here's some things that are **requirements** in my future home:**- A place where it is safe to be yourself**. I'm gay, so that automatically erases at like half the countries in the world. I'm not worried much about people here and there who hold strong beliefs, I'm already used to it in the States, but at the very least I want to know I won't be murdered, put into jail, or fired from my job if an employer/government finds out.

**- A place with a sense of community.** Moving to a new country is going to be difficult. A top worry for me is finding friends. It's one of the reasons why I want to find a career that's more group/coworker oriented, as it's a good way to network with people and form relationships. I like happy people, and if finding a sense of community with locals is going to be exceedingly difficult, then I'm probably going to be sad.

**- A place where access to decent healthcare isn't only for the wealthy/privileged.** Here's what I understand about developed countries (except USA), and even many developing countries. Basic healthcare is available to everyone usually, even new residents/visas (not yet citizens). That includes things like emergency care, and other necessary things that can't wait. Some offer more, some offer less, but you can expect to not be in financial ruin for an emergency. That's my main goal right now, as that is not the case in the United States. I actually have insurance right now, but I still stay at home most of the time when I am sick, and only go when it gets really bad, to my detriment, because my insurance is cheaper for ER visits than doctor visits unfortunately. I may have been close to getting critically ill a few times in my life now. The good news is, my age is on my side at the moment, given I am relatively healthy and young, my healthcare needs are not likely to be very big for the foreseeable future, especially specialty stuff that is unlikely to be available at the same capacity as it is to citizens of the respective countries. **TLDR:** I am fine waiting years to be able to be a part of my new country's universal healthcare system, as long as I can expect to be taken care of during an emergency situation without facing financial ruin.

I also have a few **preferences**.

**- Colder (on average) climate.** I actually have a condition that makes me sweat a lot more than most people. I have medication that controls it, but if I moved to a hotter and humid climate, I'd need to take it daily, maybe even twice, and it does have side effects. Sometimes I forget it, and I don't want to be known as the 'Sweaty American' haha. It's not a requirement though, just a preference that can be overlooked in lieu of a better life. For some more specifics, where I live now, the climate ranges from the cold winter nights being around 0C (32F), while the the average summer day ranges from 20C to 30C (60s to 80s in F). I manage pretty well now, and could handle a little more heat, but I'd like to try living somewhere colder and see how I do there.

**- Low cost higher education.** In the case that I need to search for new job opportunities in my new country, I'd like to know I can get educated if needed without making sacrifices like selling things you own, cutting back on food, going into debt, etc.

**Something to look forward to.** My main issue living in the U.S. is the culture of wealth and success at the expense of the well being of others. It seems that's the main thing people look forward to when living here, but, while it sounds appealing, I also understand that we don't live in a world with abundant resources for everyone. Not everyone can be wealthy, and not everyone who can be, will be. It just makes it worse that so many people in our country are suffering, with children going hungry and hundreds of thousands living on the street. I worked at McDonald's before the lock down, and it brings tears to my eyes when I see so many people come in that are homeless, crying, on drugs, with mental issues, etc. Our government isn't exactly doing anything cool at the moment. Some of my teachers have been working 2 jobs, some of my friends are at risk of homelessness, etc. Social services are being taken apart, rather than improved. Economic prospects for the younger generations are stagnating and getting worse. Even my parents are worried for us, as while my parents aren't well off, it's difficult to imagine that my brothers and I are going to be better off than they were. When my community isn't improving and there's nothing I can do to help, I just can't put myself through this anymore. **TLDR:** I just want to move somewhere that is improving/progressing, even if it is at a lower point than my community is today, because at least I know that I'll be a part of a country that is getting better every day. The inequality in the U.S. makes me depressed, and I have the feeling of being powerless, when even people who I thought would end up doing well have been crushed.

**What I am willing to do/leave at home:**

\- I am prepared to save at least $20,000 before moving, so I would have enough money to support myself in the event that finding a decent job in a new country is difficult in the beginning. If I sold my car I would have $40,000.

\- I am willing to learn a new language, even one that would take more time like Swedish, German, etc.

\-I am willing to work longer hours in a new country (Over 40/week if needed).

\- I am willing to live in a country with a higher crime rate. I'm not sure about how much higher, as where I live now, the rate of being a victim of any crime, violent, theft/property damage, etc, is 10% annually. I haven't been a victim yet but some of my friends and family have been.

\- I'm fine living in a country with less rights, like freedom of speech, guns, etc, as since I am an American citizen I could probably come back if it truly was a deal breaker.

\- I am fine living in a country with lower wages, given that I can still get basic things like healthcare and housing.

\- Lastly, I'm fine with giving up marijuana. Where I live it's legal and highly abundant. You'll be smelling it while driving many areas here lol. Despite it being a part of my culture, I'm willing to move somewhere that is more anti drug.

&#x200B;

**My goal of this post:** I'm hoping to get a sense of direction from the community on here of where to look/what to look for. I have dreamed of living in a better country for years, but my breaking point was the Covid-19 situation. I'm now fully devoted to leaving, even if that means getting an specialized education before I leave, working 2 jobs, learning a new language, etc. I am lucky that I am not in a terrible situation right now, as my parents are letting me stay with them for at least another year, maybe two considering the economic situation right now. Because of this, working 1 full time job is more than enough for me to support myself (Transport, food, some money for my parents, etc), so working another job I could easily save money to fund myself moving to a new country. I don't expect to move right away. The plan is within the next 5 years, which should be ample time to prepare myself when I finally have a target in mind, so I can learn a language (if necessary), get education, etc. I have some friends who are interested in forming a pact with me to all save money and get educated in some field that would be beneficial moving to a different country as well, which if it worked out, would be pretty beneficial to have a support network if we all moved together.

**Are there any countries that are suggested to look into for someone like me?**

About me:
I am currently in my second year of university as a European Studies major. The main requirements for my major, if you are unaware, involve European politics, languages, and history. Through this I currently have varying proficiencies in Spanish (B1), German (B2), and Italian (A2). I expect both my German and Italian to be significantly better by the time I graduate. While I'm not really sure how I will be able to use this degree in the job market yet, I have experience in the automotive industry and would like to possibly get a job in that industry. Potentially doing marketing or PR, but I'm not really sure. Alternatively, I have explored the possibility of getting a master's degree and later doing a PHD. 

Requirements:
Better healthcare system
Potential for cultural experiences and travel
Paid vacation time
Decent political climate

Preferences:
Good car/motorcycle culture
Good economy (recently anyways, let's ignore COVID)

What I don't care about:
Tax rate
Not having guns
Not having a car (I still want to ride a motorcycle though)
Learning another language (Both French and Dutch are on my list to learn, but I'm open to anything)

My current country shortlist includes Germany and Italy at the top with Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Sweden behind. I'm planning on studying abroad next spring (assuming Coronavirus doesn't mess that up) and hopefully I will get the opportunity to travel and experience these countries.

My biggest concern is not being able to get a sponsored work visa or an EU Blue Card. I am open to working here for a couple of years to save up money, assuming I won't have enough already (I also don't know how much that will be).

I'm hoping to hear from people who have made similar moves and are familiar with the visa processes, who may have advice for me going forward. I would also like to know if should consider any other countries I left out.

I've previously had a few short lived (2-4 months) internships in social media management and experience working with a startup company in Paris while studying abroad for a semester, which I helped create a strategic marketing plan and branding strategy for.

I fear my Bachelors is too broad and has not prepared me with enough technical skills to get hired, so I've considered returning to school to get a Masters. I've been looking at Germany or a university in Europe with low to no tuition fees as I'm still trying to pay off my student loan debt from undergrad and have been working as a waitress in the hospitality industry while job searching trying to start my career.

Another equally important reason I've considered a Masters in Europe is because I plan to move out of the United States and permanently live in Europe or the UK, as I feel the lifestyle aligns better with me than here (Southern California). While studying abroad in France for 4 months I visited London, Edinburgh, Amsterdam, St. Gallen (Switzerland), Brussels and Venice. And on a previous trip visited Stuttgart and Rome. I enjoy each of EU's individual and unique cultures, but am by far interested in the history and culture of the UK/Scotland and would like to live/settle there at some point in my life.

I have also been considering France since I have learned a little about how their system works, although the language barrier was difficult at times to make friends. I am working towards becoming fluent eventually but am only at A2 level right now.

Does anyone have any suggestions for me as far as what Masters I should pursue and what steps I should first take in this journey to becoming an expatriate?

* Graphic Design / Illustration (low technical skills, self-learner)
* French language
* Western European History
* Mental Health / Wellness
* 5+ Yrs in Service Industry (craft beer)

g1m8o3,[IWantOut] 20M Engineering Student USA -> English Speaking Country,1586959635.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/g1m8o3/iwantout_20m_engineering_student_usa_english/,"[IWantOut] 20M Computer Engineering Student / Freelance IT US -> English Speaking Nations

**My Situation:** 

I'm currently enrolled at a full four-year engineering program at a school with a solid engineering reputation and am currently halfway to obtaining my degree (I plan on finishing it before pursuing anything else). I am a first-generation United States citizen and have dual citizenship in Brazil as a result of my parents' citizenship status. 

I am tired of the situation here in the United States, and the direction that our two-party system is leaning. I'm disappointed in the leadership, as well as the general ignorance of the public. The ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps"" mentality is becoming toxic and is turning people against each other. I'm tired of mindless consumerism and the hole the U.S. is digging itself. I'm tired of Wall St, bailouts and all that malarky that I'm not gonna continue ranting about.

**My Skills:**

In my free time, I run a computer repair/resale business, I do commission builds and light IT work.

I have decent programming skills and I am knowledgeable in a handful of languages (and am adaptable to pick up others) as well decent knowledge of algorithms and their applications.

I fiddle with hobby electronics and have a good understanding of circuit theory/power etc.

I have general manual labor skills, having worked in moving, construction, freight delivery, etc for all of my childhood to teen years.

I have great administrative skills, having worked as a shadow for the VP of a Fortune-500 partner for several months.

I speak English and Brazilian Portuguese (natively) and also speak basic Spanish.

**Basic Requirements:**

*""First World Problems""* \-- While this may seem a bit privileged, it is certainly something I prefer not to part with. This includes clean drinking water and other public infrastructure such as roads, libraries, municipal services, as well as other creature comforts such as good internet &, etc.

*Safety* \- While we (the US) can be considered to be the butt of most jokes concerning this topic (mass shootings & gang violence, anyone?), Safety is a big concern for me, as I grew up and lived in ""the rough part of town"" my whole life, and want to leave high crime/homicide rates as well as gun-related violence behind.

*Community -* I don't mean this in a ""howdy neighbor! come to the barbecue"" way, but one thing that was ""cool"" about the US was a shared patriotism (for better or for worse). I don't mean xenophobic or jingoist beliefs to the point where a body/nation can admit no wrong, but some sort of unifying ""identity,"" just like how the ""ideal American"" is a hard-working, love-thy-neighbor, and advocate for your rights person. What I'm saying is that I would appreciate if people took their ""individual responsibility"" seriously (as we see a lack thereof here in the US with the Covid-19 crisis).

*Healthcare -* I don't want to be thousands of dollars in debt for an IV, and I don't want people to die because of simple complications. Everyone should have it, and it should be affordable, plain and simple.

**Goals/Motivations:**

Long story short, my parents sacrificed everything and went through hell to come to this country to give me a better life and prepare me for bigger and better things. I lived through hellish poverty and conditions that I would never wish on my worst enemies. I love my country, it gave me and my family hope when nothing else did, but, I am tired. It seems like everyone is out of their minds, and it seems like nobody listens to plain facts anymore. I need to get away from it all and have a fresh, new start, away from the mess that is American politics.

I did look at the differences in tuition and among those schools (it's such a good feeling to see $0 tuition in Norway and Germany!) and am aware of Norway's student visa requirements.

I have dual citizenship and was born in the states, have lived in Phoenix when I was a child- this would be my first huge move as an adult.
Times are crazy right now and the economy is volatile in Alberta due to the oil and gas industry, which we work in. My fiance is currently laid off and I am still working. We want to know if it would be worth it to move to Phoenix. We have family there and they would be able to get us jobs or there is work in both of our fields (I have checked). Our daughter will be starting school in a couple years so this would be the perfect time to make this transition. I'd just like to pick some brains on whether this would be a good decision. I know it's different for everyone, but I'd like to hear from people.
We currently don't own a house, just rent. We finance both of our vehicles. We have substantial amount of consumer debt and home ownership in Alberta looks near impossible any time soon. If we made this move would it be better to sell of all of our stuff and buy down there? Or rent a Uhaul?"

My country was never a good fit for me,bcs of the Slavic mindset and politics, but ever since the corona paranoia i just hate its hostility,the rise in racism and emotional frigidity so much. I'm dealing with life long ,crippling depression and i can't express my feelings to anyone ,bcs here: ""real men don't suffer from that"" they just drink themselves to death instead.

I want to go anywhere in the Western EU ,except for the Germany ,Switzerland (not EU ik) and no Slavilands of course. The only exception would maybe be the Estonia as they are,allegedly ,very friendly towards the digital freelancing culture. My main countries of interest would be: Finland ,Netherlands ,N.Spain ,S. Italy or maybe Sweden since i started to respect their non paranoic approach to the latest corona hysteria. I'm a bit embarrassed to admit ,but a decent welfare system would be important for me at the beginning ,until i can start making $ in the photography sphere again. I don't need much ,as i'm not a materialist ,so financial aspects of the country aren't that important to me. I can work automotive or whatever i qualify of course, but would have had preferred to stay in arts as i love them, invested in them ,and made an effort to build a somewhat decent portfolio.

I'm fluent in English,Slovene obviously ,Croatian and i understand some German. I'm very good at self learning new languages and finding out how the societies work and i want to learn the language and culture ASAP in order to integrate to the host society and show my respect towards the country.

My main, probably stupid question would be: Since the corona paranoia is it even possible to emigrate? Where can i find info? My country is closed for tourism but you can go out for business reasons.

I'm sry for the long post ,i'm terrible at ""cut to the chase"". Tnx for any possible advice and have a nice day if possible."

Idk what’s been happening to me but due to quarantine, I’ve had a change in mind. I’ve been focusing on my education (I go to a community college and I want to get into bioinformatics or bio engineering).

I’ve always wanted to be independent and when I bring the topic up, it’s a fueled argument.

Don't get me wrong, I understand the importance of hard work, but I find it almost soul-crushing how it is here. Even more so I find that life (specifically in Ontario, Canada) is rather quite boring and I see a general lack of passion in people.

I spent my last year of university studying and working in Italy and travelling around Europe. I really like what I found (especially in terms of the culture, friendliness of the people, good food and weather), but the people's mentality was too traditional for my liking. Work life is very rigid there and I found little tolerance for ambiguity or acceptance of innovation. Despite speaking the language I also quite often felt a sense of hostility due to me being a foreigner.

I'm not sure why (maybe it's the impression that I got from my Latino friends) but it seems to me that Latin America is in some ways a mix of the New World (more progressive, open minded, less structured and rigid than Europe) yet obviously still has the Latin culture which I really find myself at home in.

Is this true? Am I just dreaming? Is there a place where I can find good weather, great people (who know how to party), vibrant culture, but still be good on the financial front (good job, decent salary to live comfortably)?

I appreciate any input I can get (especially from people living in Latin America).

I speak English and Italian fluently, and am learning Spanish now. I'd give myself a 3/10 at the moment, but I plan on having a good degree of working proficiency by the time I go.

I graduated with a bachelor's degree in finance and economics. I also have some work experience from internships I've done (in finance and in sales). I'd consider doing a master's degree in my destination country, but I'd prefer to work for a while first. For someone with my background, how would I fare in the job market? Anywhere you can recommend that I start looking?

I know Chile is the most economically stable country in the region, so off the cusp, that's the place I have in mind. I also know São Paulo is big for business and could probably find work there (although my knowledge of Portuguese at the moment is virtually non-existent).

Any recommendations for locations are also much welcomed.

Many thanks in advance."

I   am looking at Germany. I have been learning the language and finding   out what I can but I'm looking for advice. I've been studying German for   a few months now and my reading/listening ability is fairly good, but   my speaking isn't great. Where I work right now (alongside my studies)   is a fairly basic factory job, there are a lot of eastern european   people who speak little English who also do English classes at night school while they get settled here. I'm wondering if there are jobs in  Germany  I could realistically do while learning the language?

I'm   also wondering about how moving abroad works financially. I see people   either save a lot of money to live job free for three months or so  (like  if you were starting a business), or you get a job before you  move  over. Out of the two, the second is obviously preferable and I'm  looking  for advice on where to look and how that process works.

On   a side note,  I am a deliveroo and ubereats cyclist where I live at  the  moment. How viable would it be to live off of this if I was do it  in  one of the German cities while getting settled?

I've   got my heart set on Germany, out of all the places I've travelled to   within Europe that's the place I loved the most. Any advice on location   would be great, Frechen seems like it might be a good balance of close   to a city and not too expensive.

I'm   happy to be talked out of there though, Belgium is a consideration   because of the dual citizenship, Netherlands and Ireland are contenders   too (the only thing putting me off is the rent!)"

We are in the early stages of the expat plan. We are looking at possibly the Netherlands or Ireland. We live in DC so we are used to a high cost of living (3k a month for housing) and the terrible congestion of traffic. 

We had thought to visit multiple times in the next year to feel our way around. Move in 2 years and sell or store what we don't want/need for the trip over to get settled.

Any tips, suggestions to get the process started? I have done the research to know that my husband's job is on the highly skilled list in Ireland and that it is needed. My profession would require a general work visa. 

Oddly enough - I was telling a friend about this idea and now they are considering. Could they come over and stay with us to get a job or would they need a position before?

\- I can get my Hungarian citizenship by blood right via my deceased grandmother.

\- (From our understanding) I can get my polish citizenship via marriage after a period of time living in Poland, but can’t apply for this before moving there.

I think having citizenship in one of these countries before we move would help our situation.

I have begun the process of applying for my Hungarian citizenship, but I run into roadblocks because I don’t speak Hungarian and all of my family moved to the US in the 1920-40’s as far as I know. Does anyone have any advice as to where I can reach out to get help with this? The Hungarian consulate where I live was not much help when I asked them this question.

Is getting a German citizenship by blood right easier to navigate? I’m not fluent in German, but I can get by when I am there and can probably figure out the paperwork/forms myself, plus we have friends there that can help.

Does anyone know if there is a way to apply for Polish citizenship before moving there? I am working on learning Polish with my husband and his family and friends, but the language is proving to be quite difficult (those damn conjugations!). I do want to be able to find some kind of even part-time work when we move and I think having citizenship already would help.

* Wait until I finish my degree, then start looking for jobs. Probably the safest, but least desirable choice.
* Move without a visa, and continue working for my current employer while seeking visa-eligible employment. Gets us out the fastest, but carries the risk of not finding work before the 90-day period ends.

Not   to start off negatively,but my country (India) is becoming a tough  place  to live, given the political climate in the recent times as well  as  other issues arising from population, cramped spaces, in-affordably   housing etc and considering other personal lifestyle perks outside  India  as well.

I have a UG degree  in  Mechanical engineering but i decided to switch domains and am just  close  to completing 3 years as an Business Analyst for a smaller MNC. I  am  okay to **pursue a masters but related to Data Science/Machine learning or Finance both** of which that interest me and I believe have brighter prospects in the upcoming years.

My  primary targets are \*\*Germany, Canada, Sweden, Singapore (Other options  are welcome too if you think I am undervaluing a couple of  countries).\*\*I  understand that the EU is very vast in terms of  tradition or language  barriers etc, and hence I am okay to learn a new  language or two.

**o Germany -**   The public universities seem very ideal but competitive, but I also   heard they mostly prefer Masters in the same line of Undergraduate   studies which in my case is Mechanical Engineering, which I don't want   to pursue a career in. Is that the case?

**o Canada**   \- My express entry scores last time I checked do not pass the minimum   based on previous cut-offs, hence is masters the only safe way to get  in  or is it possible to still apply for a job and get through on the  from  here? Are there specific cities that I should target given my  interests  in Data Science or Finance?

**o Singapore**   seems ideal in a way, given that it is the Hub for finance and   logistics and hence could be in line with my current aspirations, but I   have also heard that securing a PR is almost very lengthy and as well  as  expenses are different which makes schooling etc unafforable for   international workers from what I've heard.

Further I also am curious why France and UK have not been considered as much as I see feel they should be?

The desire to make our lives better feels stumped by government policies backed by those who have little care for our needs. We have both worked hard to get where we are now in life, but it just feels all that effort bears so little fruit.

We haven't decided on where exactly we would go, but this post is more of an exploratory question to see what our options are. There's a couple of possibilities I have researched, but I would like to determine which route may be the best given our wants out of life and our options given our background.

My fiance is not interested in higher education, but I am very open to the possibility of seeking a master's degree in another country (Data Science/analytics/etc) and proceeding through the visa process for that. The concern is cost, managing student loans from the US, and cost of living for the time to do so. I was looking into German Schools for this possibility, and some are free and taught in English. We would learn German regardless of this though.

From my understanding, I may qualify for some of the skilled worker visas for some countries such as New Zealand and Germany with my work experience and degree. My fiance may qualify as well depending on which country.

Another option is using my Hungarian ancestry to gain a Hungarian Passport. My only concern is if the lineage is to far back to qualify for it. My Great Great Grand-parents on my father's side were born there and emigrated later to the US.

Thank you for your time and help with this!"

I am interested in moving from Vancouver BC to Calgary. It seems like a good place for my wife and I to start a family. (Post covid). 

We both have degrees from universities and currently work in the Human Resources field.  We are at a 1-2 year experience range. 

Throughout my research, I have seen many people saying that there are no jobs in Calgary. Is this true?  There seem to be a lot of jobs posted online but I saw another ‘IWantOut’ post from Calgary, he was saying there are no jobs in business for him. I just want to confirm if this is true?  (He is a fresh grad). 

Are people there friendly?  We found it hard to make friends in Vancouver. Can’t really put a finger on it. People would be nice and say yes to meeting up with us and then cancel last minute. 

What is a good neighbourhood in Calgary to live in so I can research a little bit more?  Not looking at million dollar homes of course.

I think we would reach our potential easier and with fewer costs elsewhere. We currently live in NY.

I  am a skilled designer who has experience with UX, branding, print, and web/ui. I am also a decent frontend developer which compliments my design work well. My next career move is looking like product management since I have natural leadership skills with the direct insight needed to manage design and development teams. But, I am not against staying in a design or dev role if it would be an easier move to make.

My girlfriend is currently closing in on her bachelor's in psychology, and she teaches yoga and fitness classes online to bring in income. She was working as an office manager in a wellness center before the lockdown cut her hours down to nothing. She's still weighing her options regarding what she will do once she finishes her degree, so she's pretty flexible and open to various opportunities. At the very least she can continue to teach her classes wherever we go since she's begun transitioning her classes online.

Regarding where we want to go to our choices vary in reasoning and likelihood.  Canada would be easiest and most convenient as far as we know. It's also the most similar to where we live currently so that can be both a pro and a con. I know that the job market in my field is prolific, so I  don't doubt being able to find work.

New  Zealand would be awesome, we love the culture and I think the country is run very well. I've always dreamed of living there anyways and have a  good family friend who I'm sure would help us with the move. I am not sure what work opportunities are like for someone like me though.

South  Korea would definitely be interesting, it would provide the richest experience culture-wise and we love the food. We also think they do a  good job of running the country but we also have the least insight in this area. My biggest concerns with SK are having career opportunities despite their seemingly unhealthy work culture and mastering the  language (we've been learning for a month straight now to stay sane during the lockdown and it is going surprisingly well).

And  then there is Singapore. I enjoy how clean they are and the food there  is also great. I think there would be plenty of work opportunities given  how many companies have set up offices there, and I think it offers a  good mix of cultures.

Otherwise,  we are pretty open to suggestions and are very interested in any  insights that we can learn to help educate our goals as we plan to  emigrate over the next few years. We really just want the best for  ourselves and aren't looking to be in denial over anything."

Some background:

I'm 22 with a computer science degree, and I've been working full time as a Data Engineer for around 10 months now. Before that I contracted as a web developer. I'm not planning on moving until the beginning of 2021 at the earliest given everything that's going on right now - and I'm fortunate enough to have a UK passport since my mum was born there.

&#x200B;

* Will someone with as little experience as me have trouble finding work in my field? I'm still a junior in my current position, and I've only been working in tech for \~15 months or so. Related to this, how is the tech scene in London? It's fairly laid back here, and there are only a handful of bigger companies to work for in the city, so I expect things to be a lot more competitive in London. 
* How is finding work in general for someone with a UK passport? I'm open to work outside of my field! 
* How and where should I be looking for accommodation? I'm currently in a flat of 5 paying $250 NZD a week for my room and I expect rent to be a lot more expensive over there. What do people typically use to find flats / flatmates? 
* How much savings should I have to sustain myself for a couple months while I job hunt? Obviously this is subjective and depends on where I live etc... but if you had to give a rough estimate for say, three months? I'm planning on having around $10k.

Also, the company does have international locations but it seems like that might be a long shot if I want to approach this realistically. 

I am wondering what is the best way for me to approach my move. So far it appears that trying for a masters in Germany or another European country is a way for me to start the move because of the visa situation. However, I am curious if a supply chain/ bus admin degree would mean much in Europe or if a masters in business can lead to a bright future abroad.

About a year ago me \[27M\] and my wife \[26F\] moved to the UK from Canada on a Tier 2 visa when I took up a job as a manufacturing engineer. So far, we have both enjoyed the UK and wish to remain here long term as well as have kids in the near future.

Looking forward, I want to ensure that my position in the UK is secure against threats to my employment such as the Corona virus or otherwise. I’m currently researching backup plans in case something happens to my current position in the UK.

More details about my wife and I:

I hold a Bachelor’s of Science in Honours Physics from McGill in Montreal and am very capable in programming (major component of my job), data analysis, as well laser optics. I have worked in my current capacity for approximately 3 years. While my family background is almost entirely British, they all left a generation too late to obtain citizenship via descent. If possible, I am very open to advancing my education and obtaining a master’s degree at some point in the future. I am particularly interested in moving towards an engineering degree if possible. I work with CAD/Prototyping tools for hobbies and occasionally for work. I’m also open to returning for a master’s degree in science if the outlook in the job market looks good.

My wife has a degree in civil-geotechnical engineering from the University of Waterloo. She currently works full time in her field and has experience in construction and mining. Her work authorization is currently under my visa. She is a registered professional engineer in the State of California, and on track to be professional engineer in Canada, as well as Geologist Fellow in the UK. She is also open to a master’s degree if necessary to advance her career. She could potentially provide both of us with a Hungarian citizenship by descent if we move to Hungary for 3 years.

I want to get out of Argentina because I’m just so tired of this country and everyone here. I’m stuck in Argentina because I was forced by my mom to start studying for a degree I don’t like any more at a private University with a student loan. 

I‘ve always wanted to move to another country but I just never had the opportunity. I thought about South Korea because I recently visited it for a month for a volunteer program and I found the quality of life to be better compared to Argentina. I love the fact that public transportation can get you anywhere in Korea in less than 4 hours and food is not that expensive. 

Even though I have Spanish nationality and I could technically move to Europe at any moment, I don’t like the fact that I don’t know anyone there, and also I don’t know a lot about what the quality of life is like there and I’ve just always been more interested in living in Asia. 

I want to quit my school and move to South Korea to study. I have applied to Underwood International College and Korea University and will soon finish my application to KAIST. My main issue is that I only have around 12k usd in savings and if I get into a Korean university I won’t be able to work part-time until after the first semester. Also, UIC and Korea University, as far as I know, the most scholarship they can offer is one that covers the full tuition but nothing else. KAIST in Daejeon could offer some small alowance but I wanted to study in Seoul even though it’s more expensive to live there. 

It’s also worth mentioning that I speak quite a few languages fluently (Spanish, English, French, Italian and Portuguese) and I’m studying German, Chinese and Korean. (No, I’m not making this up, it’s literally all I did in high school: study languages). I was told maybe I could do private tutoring but it’s supposedly illegal so I don’t know. 

What I’m most worried about is my finances because I only have 12k usd in savings excluding the money necessary to pay back my student loan which will stay in my Argentinian bank account. Also, if I get accepted to any of those Korean universities, I would have to start school in September and go to Korea before then and I just don’t know if it’s gonna be enough time to get the visa in Argentina and then go to Korea and not have to do the quarantine at the government facility. 

I also have a Korean boyfriend who’s willing to support me in some ways but I really don’t want to depend on anyone. 

So, yeah, I appreciate any comments, opinions or information provided."

How is LinkedIn? I know in the UK it seems there's more recruiters than developers and pretty easy to find work is it the same in Aus? and are there recruiters that specialise in sponsorships?

## A bit about us

I am majoring in computer science with a specialization in Data Science, and I am also majoring in Foreign Languages with an emphasis on Professional Japanese. I also plan to minor in mathematics. I am going to a public university and am currently pursuing a Bachelors. I would like to continue to a Masters in Computer Science. I do not expect to have any debt from the Bachelors.
My family currently lives in America but they are becoming more open to the idea of leaving to Europe.

My partner has dual citizenship from the US and EU. She is majoring in Psychology and minoring in Sociology, also pursuing a Bachelors at the same university. She is also continuing on to a Masters degree. She expects to have a little bit of debt from the Bachelors.

We want to move seeing as we are very concerned about the politics in the United States, and the overall mindset of the population. It doesn't personally affect us, but we would rather be in a more progressive place.

## The plan

We want to move out as soon as we receive our Bachelors, and have enough money saved up. This will probably be in a time-span of around 5 years. 

We are heavily considering the Netherlands, because of their very progressive policies, high employment opportunities, and their seemingly better way of life. We are both bilingual, and are prepared to learn a new language from scratch from now until we are fluent -- this includes the motivation to attend language school and university classes.

We are also considering Germany, Sweden, Denmark, and Ireland (not in any specific order).

We were considering transferring to a university in the EU on a study visa, get residence, and then apply for citizenship. She has family in the EU, but I do not.

## Questions

- At what point in the process of moving should we expect to find the most difficulty?
- What should we expect as far as cost of living compared to living in university towns of USA
- Recommendations of language resources (subreddits, videos, online courses, language schools, etc.)
- If you have done something similar, what is something that surprised you culturally?

Which country can I migrate to, that would be happy to hire a biology PhD, with good pay and work-life balance (both academia and industry are okay)? I intend to return to India on retirement, so citizenship/PR is not required.

I would prefer a country where English is spoken widely. And though this is not a priority, perhaps where it's easy to date as an Indian (where ""all Indians are creeps/rapists"" is not a common slogan)."

So I'm currently serving National Service and I have around a year left. I've been thinking of getting out of Singapore to get a job since its pretty boring and there's almost no work life balance. Also, I feel so out of touch with the conservative mindset regarding human rights and LGBTQ+ stuffs.

Recently I went to Melbourne for a solo trip and I've pretty much fallen in love with the people and the liberal culture there. I met a couple of people that are working in Aus and NZ and they shared with me the ups and down of moving out which really opened up a whole new perspective on living abroad and building a career for me.

I feel like I need a clean break from studying and focus on building my career instead.

I was thinking of getting a WHV to get a job that focuses on Biotech/Med field or QC/QA since I have a Diploma in Biomedical Engineering with Merit. However I feel that the Diploma will hinder the jobs that I want.

I have a Pharmacy Technician & EMT certificate but I have no clue if it will be recognized since the healthcare system is way different & strict with the certification and stuffs.

I also have a couple years of work experience from working in Retail and a 3 months internship for a R&D company in relation to Biomedical Devices.

Was thinking of working up to the end of the WHV, or if possible get sponsored by the company to get a temporary work visa. If all fails, I'll just return back to Singapore to get a degree.

Would love to get some perspective or views on this situation. Thanks!"

- will have only about $5k savings
- taking my cat with me, nonnegotiable, prefer no/minimal quarantine period
- looking to pay $3-$400 USD monthly rent
- will have a remote job working online, need good WiFi

Wishlist

- within 30 mins to beach
- good healthcare 
- relatively safe for solo female
- again, taking my cat, fingers crossed no quarantine period
- close-ish to airport? Maybe negotiable 

Here’s what I know

- Ecuador is very cheap/safe
- Chile has great healthcare
- Costa Rica is expat friendly (not necessarily a requirement) 
- Peru is also low cost of living

I’m just looking for any country-specific advice from people who currently live there or who have lived there in the past. Any good city recommendations? My plan is to live somewhere for a year and use that time to travel to countries in the area. 

Any and all advice welcome, thank you!"

[Some background information]

I just turned 18 and I am supposed to graduate from high school this June. I currently work at an independent living facility for older people, doing various tasks there (mainly serving food). Obviously, I do not make much money. I don't plan to go to college, as it is too expensive and time-consuming (plus, my GPA isn't high) but instead get a trade/skill that is in demand(I haven't decided which one yet). I originally planned to take a year off and just work to save up money. 

However, I would like to leave the US as soon as possible (I have my reasons). I have heard about becoming an Au Pair or teaching English, but I'm not sure how much those situations would help me in obtaining residence. My girlfriend lives in Belgium (Wallonia) and her family said that I am welcomed there anytime I want to visit, and they would even let me live with them. I am currently learning French too. 

If not Belgium, any other country in Europe (or Canada) would be great too. I would like to know if there are any job sectors that don't require a lot of qualifications in which I could find a job in, just to get my feet on the ground.

I am considering North Carolina or Boston as my two options since I have friends/family in both - a good starting point.

I already have a somewhat good idea about what to expect (from a friend who explained things a bit) but I would like to confirm things for an unbiased perspective.

Goal: Work a blue collar job and start a small side business

Qualifications: BS in Business Administration and Management + I own a small care spare part shop (which is going to be the side business I am considering when moving)

What I have been told: 

1) You can make up to 6-7K a month if you are working in the service industry + operate a small side business (like selling shit online). Note that I am choosing the service industry compared to my domain because it is easier as a start. Plus, IF I am actually making around 4K after taxes and rent, I would be very happy regardless of what the job is. It all fits my budget.

2) Rent is around 800$ for a 1 bedroom apartment (in ""suburbs"" such as Wareham)

3) Cost of living in Massachusetts is relatively expensive, but you can make it through the month easily if you do 1).



Legal stuff:

1) In general, how difficult is it for an EU citizen to get a work permit? 

2) Do I need to secure a job first? Or can I get a work permit and go look for jobs?

3) Can I get the permit at the US embassy in Sweden and/or at the immigration office in the US?

Your insights are highly appreciated."

What I am looking for is a country where people are not obsessed with excessive work hours, have a good amount of vacation days, have hobbies outside of their work - basically a good work/life balance.

A country where public transport is all I need to get adventurous and go places/other cities would be crucial for me; no constant driving around to get from one congregation of interesting things (in worst case scenarios in America - shopping plazas) to another.

I want to live in a warm climate. Now I'm originally Ukrainian and still speak Russian/Ukrainian, which would make it easier for me to, perhaps, learn another slavic language (though I think Spanish might still be easier with an English background).

Me and my partner are at the verge of our bachelor degrees. We currently resident in Berlin. I study computer science and work as a software developer. My partner studies primary school teaching and teaches Hebrew online. We want to move away in the following year, after finishing our bachelor degrees.

We both moved to Berlin from Israel 5 years ago because of mostly political reasons, but also because education in Germany is cheap and we both hold a second, European citizenship (we're not special, it's quite common in Israel).

## What we like about Germany/Berlin

\- Very affordable, good purchasing power

\- Great career opportunities

\- Close to home - only 4hr flight

## Why we want to leave Germany/Berlin

Since we moved here, we've been studying the language to an ok-degree. We might sometimes need a friend's help with filling bureaucratic forms, but we essentially have zero problems getting around otherwise. Note that we also study in the German language.

We have a reasonable amount of friends, but our inner circle is mostly non-German, though. In Israel we both felt as outcasts, though after years of living abroad, we can't feel more Israeli, or should I say non-German (as our feelings towards Germany resonate with most of our friends, regardless of their nationality).

We very much feel that in Germany, individualism is compromised in favor of group think and conformity, something which is very much foreign to us. We tend to laugh with our friends about experiencing loads of passive-aggressiveness instead of openness and acceptance towards people acting different than the German norm, civilians policing each other, receiving long stares at the train, and much rarely, but still - antisemitism and racism.

We find these behaviors sufferable now, but we feel that as the years go by, these cultural differences hurt our daily lives and make us resentful.

One day we would also like to settle down and have kids. It is somewhat known here, that people who were born and raised in Germany, but their parents or grand-parents originate in Vietnam, Poland, Turkey or wherever aren't regarded as Germans (they also tend to self-distance themselves from the ""German"" label and rather label themselves ""Russians"", ""Albanians"", etc. according to their parent's place of origin), something which is very foreign to us as people coming from an immigration country.

Most of our German friends have Migrationshintergrund (migration background) and even they feel non-integrated into the German society. We don't want to appose those feelings on our future kids, but rather provide them an open, accepting and individualistic community, where race, ethnicity and religion aren't integral parts that describe it.

## Our thoughts regarding destinations

**Our criterias by importance**

\- Standard of living

\- Adaptation (Culture, ease of integration, language)

\- Career & Purchasing power

\- Climate

\- Distance from home

## Potential destinations:

**Portugal**

Pros: I have a Portuguese citizenship and an elementary knowledge of the language. Mediterranean climate and mentality.

Cons: Low standard of living

**Norway/Switzerland**

Pros: Great standard of living, beautiful countries.

Cons: Learning a new language from scratch (yes, Swiss-German is almost a totally different language to us)

**Canada**

Pros: Very easy integration, rather high standard of living

Cons: Somewhat hard to get a visa, distance from home

**USA**

Pros: Very easy integration, high standard of living, very high purchasing power.

Cons: Extremely hard to get a visa, distance from home

**UK**

Pros: Easy integration, rather high standard of living

Cons: Climate, low purchasing power

**Israel**

Pros: Home

Cons: Wars

Hello everyone!

As  the title says, I'm a Biologist with a bachelor degree and a work  background in scientific research (biochemistry field). I had been  planning to start a Masters program here in Brazil, but currently the  whole situation for science related works is really bad here, and  there's really no perspective for it to get better anytime soon. For the  past years the government has been making MASSIVE cuts on funds  destined to scientific research, and since like 90% of research is this  country is conducted under government funds... you can imagine. For me  it's started to feel like a waste of my time and skills to try to pursue  a career in science in Brazil, and so I've started to look for options  outside.

My main goal for now  would be to find a good Masters program that offers scholarships (I  can't really afford to pay for it). I actually graduated from the  university that was ranked the best in whole South America (Universidade  de Sao Paulo), if that helps for anything, and I have a good academic  history. Also  have good english and experience in biochemistry  research, having developed my own project during graduation.

I'm  mainly lookind for english speaking countries, but really if anyone  knows anything outside of those places I wouldn't mind if you shared it  :-). Thanks!"

I understand each of the three countries have different variations of universal healthcare, so maybe someone can help me out on that? I understand this may be very hard to calculate but I'd love to get an idea of which of the three (or any country I may not have thought of where English is the primary language) rank at in healthcare. 

As for work, ever since I turned 18 I've just been in and out of working at entry level retail stores. After this Coronavirus is over I want to be a plumber or an electrician, here in the US these careers can offer you a comfortable life (even here in super expensive Southern California), so if anyone knows how these jobs are in these countries that'd be great! I've also been flirting with the idea of using the money I earn from being a plumber or an electrician to fund going to a maritime academy to study engineering, not sure yet though.

As for what I'm looking for from these countries, I just want a place where I can earn a decent living, live comfortably, buy a decent house and what not, like the American dream I guess... just not in America. 

What I think of each country so far through my very limited research:

\-Australia: Probably my #1 pick right now because of the warm weather, never been a fan of the cold.

\-United Kingdom: My #2 pick because I really really like how many vacation days they get. The 2 weeks we get here in the US is hell.

\-Canada: #3 pick because I know it gets super cold here, however I won't let cold weather stop me if I find Canada to be the best fit for me in the future. On the other hand, I do like how close Canada is to the US.

At the end of the day I want to live somewhere with a better healthcare system than the US, just need help figuring how each system works, their pros and cons, etc... Feel free to explain what life is like in these countries or drop any other countries that I may have overlooked, thanks for any help!"

I'm a 21 year-old student from Germany. My major is business administration with a focus on international business; I'm planning to finish the degree in 2021 with a Bachelor of Arts.


As a long-term goal during/after my studies I would like to live and work in the US or Canada, but I'm unsure on how to pursue this dream of mine. I will be finishing my degree in 2021 as stated above, but after that I am pretty clueless. I want to study another degree, but I'm open to a Master's as well as another Bachelor's degree. I also wouldn't mind studying abroad, but I'm not sure if this is a good idea - the benefits of studying in the US don't outweigh the financial burden of US universities for me, but I might be wrong. Would getting a degree in the US help me find a job in my field there?
If so, are there programs for me to consider?


Another idea would be studying a Master's in Germany and doing a semester/year abroad, but I suppose I would have to qualify for a scholarship to be able to do that.


Also I'm not quite sure what to study; currently I'm considering finances, economics or International Business Administration as a Master's Degree. Will any of these help me with getting a job in the US or Canada?


If it matters, I speak German and English fluently and Mandarin Chinese and Spanish on an average Level."

I have a very ""unique"" situation. I am an American who is currently living in Russia and I would ideally like to move and live in Germany. I am looking for any advice or even opinions as to how I could go about accomplishing this goal. But first a little about me...

1. I speak English (native) and Russian (fluent)
2. I am a programmer (Front end web developer)
3. I have a Bachelor of Arts degree in Russian Language and Literature for an American university

People have told me that it is easy to find a job in Europe if you are a programmer and speak English. I don't fully buy that. I am a self taught programmer, and while I did have a brief 6 month stint at a Russian company working as a frontend developer, I have mainly been freelancing.

In my opinion, my biggest obstacles are a lack of experience programming ( I have 1.5 years of experience) and my ability to speak German (beginner). I'm not worried about having to learn German, as I am already bilingual. I'm confident I could pick up on the language pretty fast.

However, I do think the lack of experience will count against me for obvious reasons. Why would a German company hire an American with relatively  little experience in programming?

Plus the whole COVID-19 thing makes this all even more difficult...

So my question is... does anyone have any ideas or advice or ideas as far as a path forward? Where to apply? Should I apply? Should I learn German first? If so, to what level? Am I wasting my time?

Side note: I am willing to take ANY programming job (low paying, long hours... doesn't matter) in the beginning to get my foot in the door.

Any ideas are greatly appreciated!! Thanks in advance!!"

I am a programmer. I am currently a permanent resident in the Netherlands. I think I have posted before but cant come to a decision.

I am looking to move to one of the countries mentioned in the post (mistyped UK instead of US) but I cant decide on the best one. A country that is most accepting and open to pakistani immigrants. I know europe is not that accepting and tolerant to south asian people. But I assume Canada and UK are better?

Economy should be ok as well. Netherlands is very good economically and I want the next place to be more or less with the same economy. I think that already disqualifies Scotland and ireland cause the economy there is not so great compared to Netherlands. So that leaves me with Canada, England and US.

There is racism everywhere but is there a country where you will not feel like an outsider and it would feel like ""home""? Just blending in without getting any looks and weird behavior?

By accepting I mean if I live there I am Canadian or American or whatever the country is I am considered a part of it. I am not considered an immigrant anymore. There is also no racism(or very little compared to europe). I know in europe some people live their entire lives, get the nationality, learn the language and still considered an outsider by many. People are also very openly racist in europe in that they will give you looks of disgust or treat you poorly.

This person here more or less sums up my feelings. I want my next country to feel like my home and not feel like an outsider my entire life. I dont want anymore discrimination or racism.

Truth is, I've been feeling lost and trapped for going on a few years now. I'm nearing the end of my third of four years at uni, and it just doesn't inspire me anymore.

I've always felt a little bit like there should be more to my life than currently seems possible, but as I'm nearing the end of my studies I'm finding myself feeling more and more trapped. My major is French, but I'm regretting the choice as I'm simply not enjoying it anymore, and now all I face is one more (even more difficult) year of it. I'm also at the point where I'm just considering what jobs might pay well after uni, and that predictability of life just feels crushing. I want something new, something dynamic that never feels to predictable. On my current trajectory, the only certainties are going straight into work and settling and living just to work. Being back home in lockdown with my parents now is basically breaking point.

I love to travel and I feel like there's something out there in the world that will help me revolutionise my life. Something about meeting new and dynamic people all around the world and seeing rich foreign cultures really makes me feel alive, and helps me feel like there really can be more to my life.

I don't really know what I'm looking for. I just need an out, or a potential something that I can have on the horizon, just so that I have some sense of direction. I know that realistically I should finish my degree before making any drastic moves, but I need something to focus on or hope for. I have no strong ties to my town or my country, so I can pretty much up and leave pretty quickly if something promising was to come up, and if I have the means. There has to be something bigger than what my future currently looks like.

**TL;DR** \- Future looks bleak and uninspiring, need to find something bigger which I know has to exist out there"

Vocational school. (No degree.) Extensive laboratory management experience.

Myself: 24f, Medical assistant in dermatology. Vocational school. (No degree) 2+ years work experience in the medical field. Currently in school for an associates in Radiology Technology, will probably end up getting MRI/CT/cardiac certification as well. This will be for a medical imaging technician role. I'll finish school in 2022.

We have a 9 month old son.

After some light research, New Zealand seems to be the easiest to immigrate to with our current qualifications, and the lifestyle matches a bit more (climate, culture.) We are landlocked geographically and would like to see water more easily than we can see it now. (8 hour drive to the nearest shitty beach.) We are outdoors people by nature. I would appreciate suggestions for cities that may match this culturally. My husband does woodworking as a hobby. We don't have deep social ties.

I was also unable to find specifics on licensing and salaries for these positions. The job searching sites seem to be vague. A radiology technologist here in the USA can clear 75k a year, easy. My husband makes around 55k in his current position. We wouldn't mind taking a big pay cut for quality of life. We truly love working in medicine and believe it is a universal right.

I've read some posts about healthcare systems in these countries having a culture of bullying, but that exists here too. There are conveniences, don't get me wrong; however, our problems with the USA are numerous and have been stated by others before.

The original plan was for me to go to school for 6 years in order to be a Physician Assistant. I'm not opposed to going back to school for a similar program in these respective countries, or even medical school.

With our current savings, we could withstand \~4-6 months of expenses. If we sold our house, even longer.

What are our chances?

I've graduated as an Officer in charge of navigational watch (OOW) from a Maritime Academy in Greece. I don't know if this helps but if it does please tell me.

If I end up working as the thing I graduated, which I'm planning on doing, will it work in my favor or the opposite? Just letting you know,  it requires a lot of traveling.

I have two Certificates of Proficiency in English – CPE and ECPE  (Cambridge and Michigan) 

I also have some lower level  English  certificates that are not that important because I have the two big boys right there.


My father is a Canadian and he lives in Canada. I can definitely go to Canada  anytime I want (well not right now)  and live there as a Canadian, but America is my destination. My question is, is it easier for Canadians to immigrate to America? Can I become a Canadian in order to get access to easier immigration to America?

I have two uncles (cousins maybe? Idk)  who live in America (Arizona). I've only seen them once in my life. They aren't close relatives. Can I ask them to invite me or no?  If yes, will that cost them  money? Will I be  a burden to them? I don't want to be a burden I don't even know them. (one of them has an arsenal of weapons and it's soooo fucking cool)


That's pretty much it. I don't have a lot of things to offer. I'm just a normal person.

My skills/professional experience: I am currently unemployed (by choice, was supposed to be traveling right now). My undergrad degree is from a top public school but in World Arts and Cultures (yeah, it was fun!). I traveled for a while after, became fluent in Spanish and Portuguese. I worked for a few years in political campaigns, fundraising, some policy advocacy, all at the state level (California). More recently I’ve worked in mental health (outdoor therapy, social work, teens/families), and I even have been in grad school for becoming a psychotherapist. However I’ve taken leave from that and become pretty disillusioned with the field in general. I’m using quarantine to learn web development so there’s a new useful skill.

Why Colombia? I have spent 6-7 months there over the span of a couple trips, though those were years ago. The culture feels so much more aligned with my values than home - people are communal, value happiness and have a love for life, share their emotions and are very present. I felt very happy there. I also love the climate, natural landscapes, colorful buildings, food, music, etc.

My hopes for making it work: This also adds to my answer for the last question. Another benefit of being in Colombia is the low cost of living. If I could work remotely and get paid in USD part-time, I could put more money into savings than I do now working full time in the US. And I could have more time to live, less time to work.

I've steered my tasks in my job towards international work, having daily skype meetings with people around the globe.

I'm close to fluent in English and have no problems talking with strangers and building a social network. I don't have any luggage, only a 3 month resignation period at my job which I'm going to respect.

My main concerns are:

* Getting my degree and experience in the field acknowledged.
* Landing a job related to my experience, I don't want to move if it results in me being a ""street sweeper"".
* I make $80k AUD right know, I'm okay with taking a pay cuy, but not by 50%.
* Racism towards foreigners going to halt my career opportunities. I am what you what consider a typical Scandinavian when it comes to ethnicity.

Aspects I don't fear:

* Building a new social life.
* Animals that wants to kill me.

\-My aunt lives in France, and I have distant cousins in Germany. Not sure if those relations will assist in anything but it's worth mentioning.

\- I am open to learning any language needed. I currently only speak English and Farsi (Iran)

\- I will have a tech-oriented degree, whether it is purely science or artistic is yet to be determined.

i have recently been thinking about moving from Oregon, USA, to Münster, Germany to pursue an MA, classes starting in the winter. i currently have a BA in anthropology and was thinking of pursuing this, potentially at the University of Münster for an MA in media anthropology (i'm specifically interested in the meeting grounds between media, mysticism, labor history, and capitalism).

i'm drawn to Münster for a few reasons off the bat: it seems tuition is free; i pass all the base requirements to be admitted; classes are in English (i don't currently speak German but am happy to throw myself into learning if i get any closer to this plan). if there's other schools in Germany or elsewhere in Europe that check those boxes i'd love to consider those as well).

budget: due to COVID, i was laid off and am currently collecting unemployment. i do not have much savings to speak of at the moment at all; however, recent legislation in the US has unemployed people soon collecting $600/wk on top of their existing unemployment payout, so I may be able to save around $2000/month for the next four months - hopefully more, but we'll see what this country can do. that said, i'm aiming at having $8k in savings around august, and may be able to accrue enough to pass that $10k watermark Germany seems to ask students to have by the time classes are approaching [what is the usual timeline for having that money? it is when i apply, or whenever i can furnish it?]. if i don't have that money ferreted away at the moment, i could probably ask a family member to sign for it, but what is the actual expectation of payment on that front? i imagine when i get to Germany i'm going to try finding work as a graduate assistant or in a pub, learning German the while to open up more opportunity over time, and intend therefore to be financially independent. if i ask a family member to ""sign off"" on the monetary aspect, how much will they actually be on the hook?

job history: i have done some volunteering work in anthropology/archaeology-adjacent fields, however i've mostly been in the food service industry since i graduated. longterm, i would be looking at using what i gained from that degree experience to be facilitating labor representation and organization, maybe in union organizing specifically; or trying to set myself up with a kind of media analytics job; or continuing in education to get a PhD and then teaching.

other factors: i'm a musician on the more experimental end of the spectrum and would love to be in a place where i can consistently play shows and perform and be among other people making weird shit. thoughtful artsy lefty types, i guess.

I might have some nursing experience or be a certified nurses' assistant (CNA) by the time i leave the USA - would this type of training transfer over to Germany, and could i expect to find employment through it if so?

I'm an Indonesian student currently studying in China and will graduate soon with a BS in Computer Science.

I plan on pursuing a master in Norway then go for PR, but am confused whether it'd be better to work first or go straight for masters?

The dilemma comes from how china is handling the covid and since I am a chinese descendant, it worries me that bias will develop as time goes on...

Due to recent troubling developments in the US, I’ve decided that it’s time for me to say goodbye. I’ve only just started my research on moving to the UK (Canada is an option but I’m researching UK first) and had a lot of question, particularly career related.

I have a Master’s Degree in Aerospace Engineering in the US and have held a full-time position as a controls engineer for 3+ years. I have a very strong programming background, primarily in C++, Python, Rust, and can pick really any other language. Truthfully, my day-to-day work is more similar to a software engineer than an Aerospace engineer. I’m starting to look at how I can move to the UK and had a bunch of questions. I don’t expect any one response to answer all of them, but hopefully the sum of your responses can give me a clear picture. With that in mind, here are my questions:


1.	Overall… how are my chances looking? Do my age/profession/qualifications seem to put my as likely to succeed in my long-term goal of fully moving to the UK?
2.	Should I be trying to apply for programming jobs instead of aerospace engineering jobs in the UK? I did a cursory search and many aerospace engineering jobs in the UK seem to require a security clearance, which I suppose I would not be able to obtain as a migrant.
    1. If I should pass over the aerospace engineering jobs, what would be my long term path to being able to re-enter that field? Should I just consider that aspect of my career over…?
3.	Is there anything I should know when searching for jobs? Does the job specifically need to mention that they’re willing to hire non-residents or can I apply to most jobs that I see?
4.	My current pay is around $100K USD. I get the impression that, whether I do aerospace engineering or software development, I would be taking a pay-cut of at around 30-40%? While I could live with this, is there anything I’m not considering when having that sticker-shock or do I need to just put up with it?
5.	What are prime locations in the UK for aerospace or software professionals? Are there any hot-spots in the UK (besides London) worth looking out for where opportunities are good?
6.	I currently live in Los Angeles, and so my monthly housing expenses are around $2500/mo for my 1-bedroom apartment. What’s can I expect to have to pay for housing in UK in locations with good job opportunities? (I know London is comparable, but what about the rest of the country?)

I thank everyone who answers in advance. I tried doing some research in advance, but I need to speak to some real people to help me feel good about what I’m doing! If I have missed any rules or anything, let me know and I’ll try my best to rectify any issues! : )"

My husband and I are both very far leftist, and we just can't deal with the US any more. We're thinking Canada right now because, well, it's easiest. We own a large house and don't want to have to sell everything we own and re-purchase overseas when we could instead move everything by truck.

As of this moment, we're most interested in Toronto because it's a big city (we're Chicagoans) and because it's on the Great Lakes & a big reason we bought property in Chicago was concerns about future water scarcity due to climate change and would like to keep the benefit of having a direct pipeline to the largest supply of fresh water on earth.

So here's the main concern: my husband is a software engineer who works in a very desirable programming language that has a global need and is therefore readily employable. I, on the other hand, am a database administrator by training and experience but have been unable to work because of health reasons since July 2018. I'm afraid of the difficulty of getting a visa due to my inability to work. Does anyone have any experience with that?

Also, I'm obviously very interested in learning how the health system (especially the mental health system, as I suffer from debilitating PTSD) work in Canada and would love to know where to start learning about that.

A little bit of background, I was born and raised in the States but was raised into the Greek culture and have been to Greece multiple times. I can understand a majority of conversations, but am aiming to get fluent in the language. When I was in Greece, I felt at home and felt happier. A lot of people tell me ""oh you were on vacation"" but there's more to it than just that. 

The reason I want out is because I'm not a fan of a lot of cultural norms and practices in the US. I live in a red state. And while I consider myself fairly moderate, it's nice to see progress being made and I think we're at a stagnant point in time. I hate the fact that taxes are spent on pointless wars instead of services for the citizens, I hate the gun issue here, I hate the crappy education system, and I can't STAND the corruption going on here. In my state, the governor pushed so hard to keep the state open because he was bribed by buisnesses to keep it open. I see how Greece is handling COVID19 and considering the circumstances, they are doing great. 

There are other things that I don't like culturally in the US such as the fact you have to drive everywhere, the drinking culture, and just the sheer ignorance of a few people I have encountered when it comes to other cultures. I had someone ask me if Greeks speak a weird language and then ask if we worship the Greek Gods. 🤦‍♂️ I just feel I can relate with Greeks more because that's the culture I was brought up in. 

The thing is I have family over in Greece. So I wouldn't be completely new there. I have an above average understanding of the language and probably could get fluent if I spend more time there. But my questions are. 

Is the healthcare system good? I've heard mixed things. 

Are there more job opportunities than before? 

Do you have to do military service to become a citizen.

How much will my grades matter? I have ADHD and didn't find out until last semester so I have a couple failed classes until now. I also didn't do too good in high school (though I go to one of the top music colleges in the US, they didn't ask for my GPA or ACT or SAT scores on my application.) I haven't taken any language classes and I read somewhere on this sub that you need 2 language credits. I also went to an engineering vocational school in high school, half a day spent at public school, half a day spent at the vocational school. I mean I don't want to be an engineer and never did, my mom kind of forced me into it, which is why I'm a music major now. But that's something I have on my transcript as well.

How much will I have to save up? Working is very hard for me, due to my ADHD. I need a stress free environment or I am unable to function, which is a rare occurrence here when it comes to jobs that are available to me.

I have a moderate knowledge of Spanish but I anticipate picking up the vocabulary quickly. Due to already knowing some Spanish grammar, I am not interested in Brazil.

I especially would like a place that has good local food, I love authentic Latin American food. I would probably prefer a main city, like Santiago or Buenos Aires, and I would want to be in a place where there is both low crime and where the dollar goes far. I don't do clubbing, but I like the idea of a fun nightlife such as what I saw when I was in Spain. As in, people are up late but they're having fun and eating late meals and maybe going to shows. That would be awesome.

Also if anyone is an expat US veteran do you know whether entitlement for VA care means you can see a foreign doctor and have the bill picked up? And, more importantly for me, can I still get my VA-prescribed medications shipped to me for free?

I don't think I want to touch Venezuela or Colombia. I am also sticking to South America, in part because there have been so many Americans who have moved to Panama and Costa Rica and I'd prefer to go in a little bit of a different direction.

I am a US citizen from birth and will be able to obtain a US passport. I would not intend to work, but live on my monthly check. It is not taxed in the US, would it be taxed in a South American country? There's quite a bit I don't know, so any insight you could provide would be incredibly helpful.

I also have experiene with Brooklyn Public Access television and have certificates of training in Multi-camera shows (such as talk shows and news broacasting) and live performances (like Broadway theatre companies, specifically in lighting). I am not a degree holder however and have about two years of community college under my belt. The Made in NY PA program is from the city, and they supply with me with two years of job placement within the industry. In the near future (after this all clears up) I plan on training with them for editing and special effects, which extends my job placements by two years.

In a couple years (3-5), I would like to move anywhere, but I have trouble discerning my options as NYC and LA seem to be the 'global' capital of the industry. I'm very open to 'non-fancy' places. I'd simply like a place with accessible healthcare, stable income, and internet that isn't too oppressive towards the LGBT community. Ideally, I'd like to work for a small news station, outside of but not too far from a city or remotely editing. 

Places like Thailand, New Zealand, South Korea, Australia or Canada interest me. Something closer to nature than NYC.  I speak two languages (English and Korean) however I am very open with learning a new language. I am also open to getting a TESOL certificate or learning coding or programming, if it helps my prospects at all.

I have about 15k in savings. I speak Spanish fluently and I’d say my English is advanced. 

I’m not able to get any loans in Panama because I don’t have credit. My parents have always controlled my expenses. I just have my bank account. 

I want to study something related to cs, been really interested in Data Science but I’m sure no college costs 15k in Canada or in the US. 

I thought about learning on my own on websites like edx, lynda or coursera but I doubt it’s going to be enough for me to get a job."

However, I hear predictions of a second wave in November/December and we may be back in quarantine world for a bit. That may interrupt my plans. Predicting the future is getting to be a pain.

It's my first time writing over here. :)

I was supossed to move to Europe in Juni. I bought my flight ticket at december (just one way) but then Corona Virus appears. Nowdays I don't know what should I do. Maybe the best is going to postergate my flight and my plans to go to Germany/Austria to live...

In spite of this, It would be great to have some advices and tips. My wish is to install myself in Europe as soon as I can. Here things are getting harder and I'm tired of the bad economy that my country suffer frequently since lot of years. Adding another factors It's always the same thing over and over and I want to grow proffesionally and have a better quality of life. I worked hard for years in many differents works and companies and I'm in the same boat as years ago living with my parents and so. Fortunately that helped me a lot to save money and achieve this desire that I have for a long time but it's a little bit sad to go out because I quit my university studies for example .( I'm not going to finish them if I keep staying here at Argentina, because I need to work). It's a shame to have this necessity because here at home we don't have enough money to mantain the things and that delay my studies, the count that I made was something like 10 years of keeping studyng in order to graduate for a title that is artistic and doesn't ensures menothing. Adding to keep living on my parents house and working at the same time.

I choose Germany/Austria because I know the german lenguage (level b2/c1 certified) and because I have the German passport and nationality too. I think that it's going to be the easier way to move on there in Europe. My idea was moving to Köln but then I noticed that I love so much Austria and their cities. Specially Vienna ! There is so modern and different than the Germany promedy cities that my brain blow up. Adding that I like more their culture and find people cooler ( I meet some Austria guys and they're so different than the german people).

So, what should I do ? I was suppossed to fly at Juni in order to move to live there (it's not just a trip of holidays, this is why is so important for me to do this correctly and I write here)

Should I go to Austria or Germany? Pros and cons? Which one will be better? I know that Austria is a little bit expensiver than Germany, but maybe if I get a job quickly it's not going to be an issue. I prefer quality of life, comfortable housing, social security and medical care. I am looking for where I can grow professionally and work, I have no problem working whatever it takes to settle there. Maybe as second job I can do some photography stuff for brands as freelancer .

I am a calm person, I am not much of going out at night and getting out of control and I want to prioritize other things. I don't know if that helps at all but any advice would be great.

**Summary data:**

*I'm 22 years old, german - argentinian nationality, 4 years of experience as administrative analist in two international companies on the financial field, 2 years of university in filmmaking (not finished), and 2 years of freelancing work (photography, videography), lenguage that I handle: german (b2-c1 certified) english (advanced) , spanish (native) , portuguese (intermediate)*

I'm slowly hatching a plan to spend a year living off of my savings, while working on a project to see if I can get it off the ground. For anyone worried, if I did decide to do this, I'd be fine after the year was up if it didn't work out. I'm 32, with ok credit and solid renting history, so I imagine offering to pay a lease in full to a reputable property management company would get me past the no income barrier when trying to rent a place. If anyone has experience with this specifically I'm all ears!

My only requirements are:

1. Decent internet (maybe 25 download and 1 upload at the slowest)

2. Low crime

3. Basic standard of living like USPS service, grocery store/pharmacy nearby

4. My own place, 250 square feet at the smallest

And that's basically it. I'll be working 10-12 hour days, 5 to 7 days a week, so the city/town I end up in is almost trivial as long as it meets those requirements. I'm hoping to spend 300-600 dollars a month on rent for reference. Hit me with your best cheap one horse towns in fly over states. If I decide to do this, I'll literally move anywhere that meets my requirements. I'd even consider moving out of the US if feasible."

It could be permanent if we enjoy living there or just temporary till we are able to move another country like back to Australia or maybe NZ. I am really not fussy about where I live but at least we should be able to find jobs and have a basic standard of living.

His Civil Engineering degree is accredited by ABET but he lacks work experience for most skilled work visas. His native language is Arabic and his English is okay.

He is applying for Masters programs on scholarship in other countries but I am not putting all my hope in that, especially with the virus situation right now. His family won't support him in any plan he has to move away.

As for me, I have a Bachelor of Arts, major in French language, certificate in Early Childhood Education and Care, I will also have completed a Bachelor of Behavioural Science this year as well as a Graduate Certificate of Education (in TESOL). I am also considering taking up a Masters of Education, which would not take me too long because I already completed some of the subjects. I am a native English speaker and speak French at an advanced level. I know other languages at a mediocre level but could improve (German, Hindi, Punjabi).

Does anyone know some countries which are fairly easy to migrate to and work in despite lack of experience? Please let me know. Of course all of this is intended to happen after the virus situation has improved."

Here is the context : I finally got a job in which I can take days off, and I planned to visit several countries this year to make myself an idea of some locations that are in line with my values but... yeah, I don’t need to explain… I’m not planning to leave soon.

Your help, point of view as a local will be really valuable for me as it helps me in this decision-making process ; any point of view is appreciated (maybe tell me a bit about your situation/background if you want, it’s always nicer I think). Also I’m literally trying to map-out what I exaclty want and where I want to go, which requires some sort of introspection (can I say « psychological nudity » lol), don’t be harsh !

My skills : I’m a secretary with a bachelor’s degree (executive assistant) - I know, not very impressive BUT I am willing to continue studying (vocational training or a master degree are my only options I guess ? Maybe certifications). Languages (French/Dutch/English/Spanish ; currently learning Russian, but I love learning language so godamn much it can be any language <3), and solid soft skills as any good assistant (communincation, time management, trustworthiness, multitasking, stress-resistant and stuff). I’ve worked for a notary firm, law firm (Luxembourg), at a university and now in a public institution (at european level). 

What do I look for in a country ? I love nature, and I'd love it even more when the country wants to protect it. Public space that BELONGS to the public (aka public infrastructures made for the people and that you can enjoy!). Good public transportation (I don’t want to own a car anymore. I prefer to rent one when I need one). A simple, down to earth culture. I love sports (mainly running and swimming atm).

I lean towards values such as fairness, freedom of expression, service. I value tolerance and kindness more than personal wealth / reputation or competition. I don’t value material belongings. I see spirituality/religion as something very intimate and personal, that you share with close ones only. I love history and cultural things (museums, concerts, cultural heritage in general). I’m usually optimist and weather doesn’t affect me that much (yay Belgium).  I don’t want to screw or hack the system. I would see myself as a hard-worker but not in a toxic way (my life/who I am and my work are 2 distinct things). I’m curious, I always on the look to learn something. At work, I try to optimize things as much as possible. I like making things smooth for anybody I work with. I am half Greek half Belgian, but both my parents have spent their life in Belgium and I have Belgian nationality.

Why do I want out, what do I not like about my country ?

\- Fucked up tax system and pension scheme (aka we gon get nuthin’)

\- 4 or 5 different governments, I can’t remember (I think 5 but one of them is out these last months)

\- Division inside the country, I don’t particulary feel « Belgian » but I don’t deeply hate my country and people. Everything is divided

\- Constant stigmatization of my region / city

\- Shit transportation system... out of Brussels you need a car

\- Not advanced technology wise

\- The parks and public spaces in Brussels are not great

\- It’s SO SMOL and you quickly see everything there is to see

What I like here :

\- Good work-life balance, .

\- Social security is great !!!

\- (my area) warm people, easy going, not arrogant, polite (the lovely little greetings in the street !)

\- Very diverse culturally, various things to do and see

\- our deserts, beers and chicons/witloof !! 

I am still figuring out my career aspirations... I’m staying where I am at the moment because it’s a great workplace (many interesting people, learning & development, stable), however it’s a short-term contract (normally I will be renewed but given the circumstances, not sure).

Preferably, I’d like to end up somewhere chill, cultural or lively. New Orleans would be a dream, though I know not ideal. I’m interested with New Zealand and a lot of EU countries too. 

If it helps, I speak Chinese, English, and Spanish fluently and I’m very much willing to learn more. 

My options so far:
A.) Occupational Therapy 
B.) Agriculture
C.) Hotel & Restaurant Management + Culinary

The general plan was to finish studying college here, take around 2 years of experience(or less, if possible) and start processing everything by 2026. 

 For OT, the college I’m going to is WFOT and NBCOT accredited. For HRM&Culinary, they help you get a job abroad right after you graduate although this doesn’t guarantee being hired. 

I know being hired in resorts at places like Hawaii or Maldives is a reach, but what can I do to work on it? Or should I just give up that fantasy now?

Which of my options give me a higher chance to leave the country? 

I’m open to more suggestions. I’m not really that passionate about anything, so it doesn’t bother me that I’m not studying an interest. I just want to get out, live on my own, and travel once in a while."

I am a rising senior studying computer science at a US university. My country of birth/citizenship is China. I speak Chinese and English. 

Now, my plan \*was\* to seek work visa and eventually stay in US. However, due to the pandemic, I am very worried about possible upcoming recession - or even economic crisis - in the US. In this case, I'm contemplating those following options:

1. Graduate and look for work in US. I'll have only 3 months to land a job in US after graduation; if I fail at that, I'll have no choice but to return to China, and reentering US would be almost impossible unless I apply for further education. Plus, immigrating to US as a Chinese person is already a difficult and sloooooooow (at least 5 years?) process.
2. Graduate and look for work in other countries. I'm thinking other English speaking countries (I don't really have time to learn and master another language), or EU (easier immigration policies, some even give you visa for language learning). However, the CS industry might not be as good in those countries, which means an even harder time seeking employment. And once again, reentering US would be difficult. 
3. Go to grad school in US and sorta lay low until economy recovers. I would have to act fast for this option and start preparing for applications and exams asap, especially since my GPA is not that good (3.62). Besides, an MS in CS doesn't hold that much value unless you're going into academia, so I would consider it \~1.5 years wasted. 

I'm not super familiar with immigration policies of countries other than US, so any advice from you guys would be tremendously helpful. Thanks!!

PS. I don’t consider going back to China due to personal reasons. I like my field and would like to work as a programmer, so teaching English somewhere is not really an option for me either at the moment."

I've gotten several acceptances in the US, but the one I'm most interested in is [Make School](https://www.makeschool.com/).

Pros:

Bachelors degree in 2ish years
Great outcomes (I've read that international workers on visas are generally underpaid, so a 'top program' will probably help)
Still higher pay than Canada
California (I see this as a pro, though I've read otherwise)

Cons:

Permanent Residence/a Green Card is probably going to be hard to get, considering that I'm aro/ace and Indian
High Costs of Living/Healthcare


I'm mostly interested in McGill in Canada.


Pros:

Easier to become a PR/Citizen
Montreal
Healthcare
Cold 

Cons:

Much lower average wages
I'll need to learn French to work in Montreal, and I really don't want to learn a new language


I'm pretty sure that the housing market is screwed everywhere, sooo that isn't really a factor.

It has been a lifelong dream of mine to live in England. I have talked about doing this since I was in junior high, and I am lucky to have had the experience of studying in Essex for a summer semester in university. However, that was six years ago and now that I am educated and have more life experience, I want to return to England short-term.

My two best friends live in London right now. They have been there for a year and are planning to stay another year before returning to Canada. They are both teachers and are renting a nice apartment that has an extra bedroom. They have been nagging me for months to move over there with them, and I have continuously made excuses as to why it wouldn't work right now in my life. However, I know that I will regret not doing this and have decided to take the first steps in making this happen. I have already looked into getting a tier 5 mobility visa. 

I have a social work degree and have worked as a child protection social worker, a family support worker, and am currently working as a mentoring coordinator for a non-profit organization. I am looking to work in London within the field of social work/social services. I do not have a preference on the job type and do not overly care about the salary as long as I can pay my part of the rent. I am just looking to have a great life experience for a short-term period. 

Here is the thing that I know will be tricky. As of right now, I am only looking to go for about 6-8 months. This could change once I'm over there, but I do have personal reasons as to why it would be difficult for me to be over there longer.  My number one reason is my boyfriend, who would love to also come and work in England, but it is much more difficult for him to obtain a visa considering that he is from the Caribbean, so we do not see that working out for him. I am aware that it will be hard enough to find employment in London, but especially when I am only planning on being there for a short period. I am only looking within London, as this is where my two friends are and the main reason as to why I am wanting to go now. I do know of someone who spent six months volunteering in England, which is also something I am open to doing. 

I am just looking for advice on how to go about this: is there a recruitment agency that I should go through to find employment, are there other opportunities within London for a six month period, etc. Thanks all!

TLDR; I am wanting to move to London for 6 months and work/volunteer within social work/social services, but am not sure how to go about it finding a job/opportunities over there."

India is becoming a hard place to live. Like so many countries these days, it's experiencing a shift towards right wing ultra nationalistic politics. I would like to move somewhere that is English speaking,   and where I don't need to worry about the air quality or the constant corruption at all levels. I've looked into the EU countries that have a strong Engineering tradition (Germany, Netherlands, Sweden) but from what I've read and people's experiences on this sub and others, the language barrier and passive exclusion is something I'd rather not have to deal with. Canada seems to be my best option so far.

I have a bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering and have been working as a data analyst for an Oil & Gas services company for the last three years. I've recently quit though. I have saved around 18,000 CAD at the current exchange rate. I am aware that there is an Express Entry route to immigration to Canada, I'm not sure what the time-frame for that is? how long does it take to get an invite? I've also heard that professional jobs are very scarce for people who have gone down this path, is that true?

An alternative to the express entry option would be to get a masters degree from a Canadian University and apply for a PR later on. I am looking at the English colleges in Montreal, Quebec because of the lower tuition and relatively lower rent. From what I read there are just two respected institutions (mcGill and Concordia) I am aware that I'd need to learn French but since I would be planning to join in January 2021, I have the next few months to learn whatever I can. Would this degree-first route be a better option? I would need a lot more than 18K to study and live here but I might be able to scrounge up enough with some help from family and a part time job to cover a few expenses.

Also, if there are any Quebecois reading this, what is life like in Quebec? I've heard the winters are brutal but I do not mind weathering (:P) that as long as the general quality of life is good. Is there anything else you can tell me about Quebec? about the work life, community etc. I hear really good things and also not so good things so it's hard to form an opinion. 

In all honesty, I am leaning towards the second option as I think a Canadian degree would prepare me a lot better for a professional life in Canada. Please let me know what you guys think. 

Thank you all in advance!"

I'm stuck on which country I should try moving to. There are plenty of options but from what I read my chances are pretty slim to get accepted legally even though I have a college degree and speak English fluently yet somehow I see people from all over the world with none of those two things still making it to developed countries?! so there must be a chance.  

So in short, Let me know which country is my best option and the best way to get in there? 

I'm a 22 year old from Tripoli, Libya. I've lived through civil wars, yes, that's right, it's an on and off thing here but this last one's been going on for a year and it doesn't seem it's going to end anytime soon. I really like living here, I have friends and a purpose, there's a lot that can be done and improved but the corruption, wars and unstable economy make it really difficult to live here. Every time it barely rains the city floods for days, in the summer we go for months with daily power cuts of up to 12hrs on average and the additional rockets falling on our homes... yeah it's a bit different from the other problems on this sub.

I'm not sure where I can go but English is my only foreign language. I can't go to the US cause of the Visa ban and even if it gets uplifted next year I still can't go cause of my J1 visa which I got from a US exchange program that states I can't visit for the next 2 years, any loopholes lol?. From what I've read most countries won't let me in unless for studying but I don't have the money for that. I'll try the Canadian immigration program but I'm not sure if I qualify, let me know what you think of this as I think Canada is my best option. I would prefer to move to a country with more ""social"" people with mixed races but Scandinavian countries are an option too I guess as I've thought a lot about Norway. All other English speaking countries are an option too and more preferable to other European countries as I won't have to learn another language.  

I'm a computer networks engineering graduate, I have a CCNA with a little work experience, currently unemployed but it should be easy to get an entry IT job in most countries. I also have plenty of volunteering experience with NGOs. Help me lol.

So in short, which country do you think is my best option and what's the best way to there?

questions:

is there an option better than France? i chose France because i already know a good level of french and i have enough time to practice even more. besides, if i recall correctly, those who get higher education (which i hope just means university and not necessarily Master's etc) can get a citizenship in 3 years.

is there any chance that i can start higher education in my destination country as soon as I'm done with high school? i mean, if i continue having very little savings, is there any sort of scholarship program for international students coming from a country like syria that can at least sustain me for the first year?

going by the french law for international students working during their student's visa period, is it possible at all to sustain upcoming academic years solely with the income provided by the limited work hours during the visa period? (I'm aiming for a state funded university)

what would be considered a good field of studies to pursue(to ""guarantee"" my employment in the destination country, assuming I'm any competent in that field)? my primary interest is programming/software development but I'm honestly passionate about anything related to the field of engineering (or whatever umbrella term is appropriate).
and liberal arts as well but i doubt these would be any relevant.

let's look at a different scenario: i pursue higher education here in Syria while saving enough to sustain me in, say, France for, say, two years.
am i still eligible for the 1.5 year long job hunter visa? and any chance I'd get employed as someone who only got a diploma in some field in a Syrian university?

apologies for how superficial or ignorant i come off as, that's part of the reason I'm here to seek further info."

First post ever on Reddit so here it goes. I have a master's degree in Applied Economics, specializing in Accounting. I have 4 years of consulting experience within a Big 4 firm; 3,5 years of Audit and 6 months of Finance Management Consulting (my current role). I can speak Dutch (mother tongue), English and French (full working proficiency) and I recently obtained my A2 in Spanish. I am also aiming to obtain a CMA (Chartered Management Accountant) in January 2021. While I do feel appreciated, have interesting training/learning opportunities and have tons of possibilities to gain experience to specialize in certain fields, I always wanted to enrol in an expat program. I am single (and plan/hope to keep it that way) and have my own apartment for which I'm paying off my loan. I can easily rent out my apartment. Ever since traveling to Brazil and Colombia I felt connected to Latin America; the attitude in general, good weather, simplicity of life, etc. I feel that the consulting life will someday end for me and want to explore all my options. Let's assume I want to move within the next 2-3 years. Hence my following questions:

1. Which country in Latin America would you recommend to work in, taking into account quality of life?
2. Which companies or sectors in Latin America would you recommend to search a job in? I would like to search for a job in Business (Finance, Management, Accounting, Economics). I have also looked at Jan De Nul and DEME for expat jobs but I haven't found anything that came close to these options (both companies active in capital and maintenance dredging, land reclamation, port infrastructure development)
3. Is the UN worthwhile to apply for? (requirements, numbers of applicants per position, etc)
4. What is the general expected monthly salary in Latin America? I currently have €3k gross / €2k - €2,9k net depending on my travel allowances
5. Next to Latin America, what would your general recommendation be if you were in my position and want to move to another country? Would you recommend other career paths / other countries?

And yes I am exploring the options for asking a transfer to another country within the Big 4 I am working in, but there are no solid options (not my expertise). Also I know that usually these requests end up in the HR mailbox where they promise you an answer and investigate the possibilities, but are never heard from again.

Apologies if I have asked questions that many people before me already asked and have been answered. I could not navigate to these pages yet so posting the link to the relevant tread would be sufficient to help me out. Thanks a lot for the input guys!"

My girlfriend is going first in August/September and I'd drive over with my car about 3 months later (cause of job cancellation terms and stuff). We are both fluent in English; she's a native speaker and I always got top grades in school (gaming and global communities help a whole bunch).

My Girlfriend did an apprenticeship in elderly care and I did an apprenticeship as social assistant (german pre-requisite for kindergardener/pre-school teacher). Questions: - How is the job market for those jobs? - Can those jobs branch out to other related fields (i.e. hospital nurse)? - Do we need to take some education or tests to see if these apprenticeships are at the UK standard? - What kind of salary can we expect? - How are the chances to get additional training to extend out skills?

So we obviously need a place to stay (i.e. a flat). Questions: - Would there be any difficulty or hindrances to get a flat as foreigners? - Do we have to put a deposit? - Are rightmove.co.uk, zoopla.co.uk, onthemarket.com, gumtree.com good search engines/do you have a better alternative? - AFAIK the UK uses different electricity outlets. Can I take and use my electronic devices with an adapter? - Is the internet stable? Is it fast?

I would like to take my German car (VW Passat) over to the UK. I know that the UK uses the Imperial system and AFAIK the only thing legally stopping me from driving my car over your place is to swap the front light cones around. Questions: - Is there anything else I need to know legally? - How is the expertise of the mechanics over there for my car? - How is the supply of spare parts for my car?

I'm open to any suggestions, I'm just starting to put feelers out to see any potential avenues I can take. Also would you suggest going to university here before moving, or should I study abroad?"

I am a federal investigator with the US government. My job is different than a special agent with the Secret Service or FBI, as I am not running around with a gun. After college, I had one year working for a state government, and ever since has worked at the federal government level. After moving, my intention would be to enter the private sector. 

Regardless, I worry about being able to transition into the private sector of a foreign job market with this career history. In the US, it is doable to move into consulting/contracting/PM with my skillset. What taboos are there for a foreign business to hire someone whose work history is a foreign governments? Another consideration is transitioning from US Gov > US Private Sector > Ireland, which may make it easier, but take additional time."

I’m really hoping to figure out what I want to do with my life before I eventually transfer to a 4 year university, but I’ve recently realized how much of a priority it is for me to travel. I’m severely depressed and I’m hoping that maybe I can learn better ways to express myself through other languages, and maybe exploring different ways of life and connecting with new people all around the world will give me a will to live. 

I had previously been thinking of focusing on things within the humanities/social sciences— double major in psychology and political science, and then eventually get a masters in social work. However, given that my target countries are not English-speaking/learning new languages is one of the larger reasons I want to travel, it wouldn’t make much sense for me to pursue an education in things that couldn’t be used well outside of the US. I’d like to get a job in a foreign country and through that, learn the language and way of life, but with my aforementioned majors, I’d probably have to become proficient in the language of a specific country I’d like to live in on my own and then apply for jobs, which doesn’t feel very efficient to me when I want to be able to travel all over with my career, not have to commit and learn an entire language all on my own and then relearn the even more specific terminology for my field every time I want to move to a new country. 

I thought maybe in between my bachelors and my masters I could au pair in different countries or become a TEFL/TESOL but neither jobs really pertain to what I thought I would be studying so if I came back to the US and applied to jobs it would just looked like I wasted time for a few years, or if I wanted to stay in the county I was working in, neither areas of work sound great for me in the long term. I’ve also looked into how to possibly make a sustainable income without a college degree online, but that sounds too unstable, personally. 

Would I have a better chance at finding work all over with beginner level language skills if I pursued STEM instead? It’s never been my strong suit, but my goal is ultimately to help people, and understand them more deeply through an understanding of language, culture, etc, and I think I could still achieve that through STEM. I also feel that a lesser degree of fluency would be needed for STEM jobs than things within social sciences/the discussion of political theory/etc. Plus, maybe with STEM I might have a better chance of finding a larger company in the US that would allow me to work abroad/work online. Hell, with STEM maybe I could even start as a TEFL in a country, become more proficient in the language as I live there, and then start applying to STEM jobs. 

Those living in foreign countries, what do you do for a living? How did you find work? Any advice for someone who still has some time to decide what to do with their life in order to keep opportunities for living abroad long term open?"

Graduating near top of the year, strong dev experience and ability, with good reputation at my job.


I'm a dual UK/US citizen, and I've been entertaining the idea of moving to the states after a few years, and just wanted some advice/anecdotes from people who live there or have made similar moves. Things like ability to purchase property, living costs, places to live, settling in, meeting people, where would you advise going, etc etc. 


Honestly I'm not all too sure why, I think I kind of want something bigger, to try a new country, but I'm also worried about what I lose by uprooting my life, what I'd miss by not being here, and if I'd do it permanently, and then if I move again, same conundrum. Also, big tech players offer salaries magnitudes higher than what I could ever achieve in the UK.  I have some family in the US, in MA, who I've visited sometimes, and being there is fun, people love the British accent (couldn't tell you why, but I love American accents too, so eh), people are nicer, more outgoing, weather isn't crap all the time. The main detractors from the states are the potentially dangerous culture, guns, the healthcare, the fauna, moving continents, and maybe earthquakes on west coast, I hear they're undesirable. 


I'd probably be looking at west coast - Seattle, San Fran, LA, Palo Alto areas, which is where most tech seems to be. I quite like busy cities, I currently live in a 15 minute bike from my city's centre, but granted cycling is probably not as viable in the US given the reliance on cars. I'm fairly salary oriented, but one of my goals is to actually get on the property ladder with a nice place, which may be counterproductive when living somewhere like these places, whereas my job in the East Midlands in the UK is great for my salary/value ratio. Kind of similar to living in London without a partner, getting housing that's not way out of the city is nigh impossible unless you get studio apartments or similar, which are still £300k.

\- Grad school at Canada, as I mentioned before, will try.

\- Applying to CS jobs at the US: H1-B way, I have read about how difficult this is :( but will look into cap-exempt jobs to see if there's any higher chances

\- Getting a job at an US company in Europe and relocating: J1, I often read this is the best way but I'm not sure, if I were to get a job at, say, Amazon are the chances of them wanting to relocate me to the US really higher than the H1-B lottery?

\- Applying to jobs at Canada. Is this option ""easier"" than relying on H1-B?

&#x200B;

For the past few years, I've grown to realize that I am ill-suited for the United States. I am becoming increasingly aware of the flaws with my country (ex- a flawed healthcare system, political turmoil, expensive college tuition, etc.) and am desiring to leave once I'm a legal adult.

 I am thinking career-wise to go into programming, IT or civil engineering due to the growing demand for these skills and am making my current education reflective of that. I am currently studying my third year of French, but next year I'm beginning a German class. I am strongly considering attending college in the country I ultimately wish to immigrate to, so that my years abroad can count for citizenship/residency status. 

 I would like to live and work in a place where there's a good life/work balance, integration into social circles isn't too difficult, and there's a reasonable amount of things to do, so not a place that is considered 'boring' (I'm an introvert myself, so an abundance of midnight raves and nightclubs is not compulsory). I additionally don't appreciate the 'car culture' of the United States, and would like to live in a country with a well developed public transportation and national rail system, so that owning a car is not necessary.

The countries I am presently considering (but am open to suggestions on) are Germany and Sweden, and I appreciate the atmospheres and opportunities of the city, so I'm looking at places like Berlin, Hamburg, Stockholm or Göteborg. 

I've been reading articles about these places, and some concerns I've read about include the fact that the job/housing markets are saturated, there's a current immigration crisis, the people are rude or grossly antisocial, etc. If these claims are true, I'd appreciate advice on how to proceed, or if I should consider other cities or countries altogether. I greatly appreciate your help, and if you have any questions that could help you understand my situation better, I'd be completely willing to elaborate. Thank you all!"

I've taken a few coding and theory intensive courses while at college, have worked on numerous projects for nonprofits, and really enjoyed the work.

Firstly, am I too late in the academic year to apply for these grad programs abroad? Most I'm finding (specifically in Japan, China, and Finland) end their application periods around February.

Secondly, outside of Germany (where i know it isn't possible period) how possible is it to transition from a policy/law focused BA to one that focuses on something like CS? Personally I feel there's a lot of intersection (E-government comes to mind, and AI pattern recognition), but I'm unsure if my BA would hinder my acceptance into an MSCS program. Masters in Public Policy or East Asian studies don't have great returns (as much as I'd prefer that, and speak Mandarin...), so an MSCS seems like a nice alternative.

Finally, are there any benefits to staying stateside at the moment? My family moved to the rural South and I'm at a loss for what to do about work. I'm applying literally everywhere and anywhere, while my family is pressuring me to go to the local college for a CS Masters... while the whole point to me is to go abroad and not just save money but build a career outside the grasp of my extremely controlling family.

China and the EU (specifically Estonia, Czech Republic, Poland) come to mind due to their growing tech industry and more importantly encouragement of foreign students into their universities. As far as I know, scholarships to Chinese universities cover virtually everything.

I had planned to go into the Peace Corps but it was cut short by COVID-19, so I'm scrambling to find work or a graduate program abroad that can support myself for 2 years away from my parents. If I hav stay stateside for another year to apply, I'd be fine with that in theory provided I can find work. I'm more than happy to hear recommendations of other countries to look into. I've also looked into Korea, Japan, New Zealand, and the UAE, but for multiple factors primarily necessity of a car in UAE and lack of Japanese in Japan) I'm hesitant about applying for quality of life reasons since I can't drive."

I feel like Canada is pretty similar to NZ, and is close to america too which could be cool for trips. Pretty sure they have decent film scene there too. Also some French culture there too which is cool.

Otherwise, maybe japan or a European country? I'm pretty much open to anything, just want to get out of New Zealand and see the world

I've always wanted to live somewhere with lots of snow during winters, I'm a huge fan of skiing and love the cold. 

I don't speak any languages aside from english but I'm willing to learn and love completely different cultures.

Thanks!"

I (21F) and my MtF girlfriend (19F) really don't like the United States and want to move out in a couple of years. I was never able to go to college because of lack of funding, while she has been fully funded by her father and is currently getting a Bachelor's in Computer Science. I have a good background in learning languages and am 100% committed to learning Norwegian before going there. She has no problem learning the language as well. Our plan at the moment is for her to finish school and work a bit after, while I continue to work here as well. If all is well we will get married in a couple years and she will go to Norway on a work visa. 

I will follow her on a spousal family immigration visa but my question is, if I don't have my own financial viability (the \~USD$14K) but instead are on her salary, can I study in Norway when I get there? Is there a way to change the visas or something like that? I plan on getting an associate's before going there to fulfill the other requirements. I know that spouses can work, but can they study?

I'm a 33-year-old Industrial Engineer Ph.D. I co-founded a software startup three years ago where I work as a tech lead. I'm also an associate professor at the College of Engineers.

Recently I took the IELTS exam and got an 8 and I've just submitted a bunch of documentation to the NZQA for qualification recognition.

I'm genuinely worried about the perception a New Zealand employer would have about my experience and CV. I'm looking for a job as a software developer or as an industrial engineer, but I don't know if my experience is compelling or not.

I'd appreciate if local employers and software developers chime in and could give me a better perspective.

In fact some people have applied for it last year already. I've gotten offers from UK universities and plan to move there via this scheme during my studies and stay afterwards.

However, the coronavirus situation has got me worried. Obviously various countries will open their borders eventually, but I am worried that it could be much later on for the UK, preventing my eligibility for this scheme as I may enter the country later. I do not know how likely that is, which is why I'm asking.

Another worry of mine is the effectiveness of the scheme itself. Isn't it possible that the UK government might extend immigration borders being up, rendering the scheme moot before December and before I and other EU students might get a chance to move? As in, what if they, following a lessened coronavirus concern, decided to not allow EU people that easily this year? I mean, my EU university fees are confirmed, and the settlement scheme says December 2020, but I'm just worried over this uncertainty.

Apologies for the paranoia. If someone could provide some insight I would appreciate it. Thank you."

I'm a UK citizen and I've been out of the UK for eight years, but I'll be returning in September to go back to university (covid 19 permitting, of course). I've already had quite a shock in that some universities classify me as an international student now because I've been gone so long, and now I'm wondering if there will be any other unexpected surprises when dealing with administrative things. Specifically...

\- Will I have any issue opening a bank account if I've just got back in the country? How about getting a credit card? I already have one - with HSBC, but I'd like to open with another bank too.

\- Will I be able to invest money in the UK stock market or UK index funds?

\- What's the best way to get somewhere to live? At this point it's not certain which university I'll be going to - definitely not one in London. It's probably going to be Liverpool or Leeds. University accommodation seems pretty poor value for money and as a mature student, it's not what I'm looking for anyway. I hear spareroom is a good site online - any others? When signing a lease, will I be asked for a guarantor/proof of income etc.? How does it usually work in the UK?

\- Any tips for managing reverse culture shock from anyone that's done something similar?

I’ve been working as a bartender after having a mental breakdown and dropping out of college almost 5 years ago. I hate it. I want to make a change so badly. I’m trying to get back into school in the fall. 

My degree is basically useless but I’ve come so far I am now obligated to finish it in this particular major - Bluegrass and Country Music Studies. (I also have the typical general education courses, but my higher level credits are Appalachian Studies courses, and things like intro to recording studio and music theory.) I do not want to make a living as a professional musician - it’s what led to the meltdown that caused me to leave school. However, I have already changed my major so many times I have to stick with this one to get done in a timely fashion, requalify for financial aid and the particular scholarship I had, and keep receiving financial aid. 

I do have an Associates of Arts but I know it’s better to try to move abroad with a bachelors degree even if it’s something useless like mine will be. I would definitely be open to teaching English, and Turkey is my favorite country I’ve been to. I know you can teach there without a bachelors but they prefer if you have one and you get paid more. 

I’ve been to several countries; my favorites, that I would consider living in, are Slovakia, Turkey, Poland, Latvia and Czech Republic (where there’s actually a pretty big bluegrass community). But, I am open to suggestions. I loved visiting Russia but not sure I’d want to live there. Or maybe I would. I would at least consider it if it were among the easier options. 

I’m so lost right now. I hate where I live. (Meaning the US and specifically the town I live in. Absolutely hate it.) All I want in life is to live overseas, preferably not in one place forever. I have no tie downs. No husband or kids and never want either one. I just want out.

I’m seeking advice on places I could move without finishing my BA, or skills to develop while I’m finishing it to ensure I am able to leave the US soon after graduating."

I've visited some countries and by far I like China the most so my plan is to study here. However, I'm really not sure, I would love to hear your opinions.   


Why do I want to study in China?   
\- Studying abroad was already on my mind for a long time , this will be a 4 year course
\- I fell in love with the country after visiting it, I'm interested in the culture and I want to learn the language.      
\- Life experience ofcourse 

Disadvantages   
\- I'm already in my first year, if I decide to study abroad I will throw 1 year away.   
\- A Dutch degree holds more value than a Chinese one. However, Software engineering is not all about a degree and the University in China is a good one. I wonder if this will impact my carreer in a bad way.   
\- Leaving behind friends, family etc.

I will have less than ~$12,000 in loans (went to community college and overloaded on coursework to get it done cheaper). I'm looking for the quickest/safest way into the EU and get citizenship to increase my options for later in life. I'm very wary of the way the world is going, and want the freedom to jump ship to multiple locales in the event of climate catastrophe/political instability a few decades from now. Additionally, I've been unhappy with the US for at least a decade, and have wanted to leave since I was a young teenager. Unfortunately, I started my education late, and my only work experience is menial, minimum-wage jobs and as a professional tutor employed through my community college.

Does anyone know about Portugal's [D7 Visa](https://priscobusinessgroup.com/d7-visa-passive-income/)? (There are so many pages on it online, this link is just a summary.)

Specifically, I'm wondering if I can save up here in the US (ideally enough for the five years of residence it takes to get citizenship, which would be around $40,000) and put it into some kind of account or trust that will pay out and count as passive income for the purposes of obtaining this visa. I am also reading conflicting sources on what counts as passive income, as well as whether or not I'd be able to work in Portugal or remotely for a company in some other country while I am there.

The ideal scenario would be to work in the US as a software engineer or any other highish-paying job that my degree gives me access to, save like mad, and jump to Portugal once I meet the requirements. If I could keep a US job and work remotely, I could live very well in Portugal and not have to worry as much about finances while I wait to get citizenship.

Does this seem doable? Have others out there used the D7 visa in this way? Is there a more viable visa route for me with this plan? I'm wary of having to be sponsored by a company and come in more traditionally, as being tied to a job for five years has the potential to depress my wages (in the US, at least, it's very common to shop around every year or two in my field for a sizable wage/benefits increase), or be horrible in other ways. For the same reason, I'm cautious about working for a Portuguese company for Portuguese wages (they are so low compared to what I can make in the US that I was absolutely shocked when I was doing research), though I am open to doing so if it's absolutely necessary. The D7 visa seems the most secure, as long as I can keep up my source of passive income. I wouldn't have to worry about losing my job and putting my residency in jeopardy.

Additionally, I'm bi, so if Portugal or some areas in Portugal are hard no's for LGBT people, please let me know. From my research, it doesn't seem that way, though I've primarily been looking at Lisbon.

From all I've read, I'm definitely considering living in Portugal long-term if I can keep getting remote work from countries with better wages. I never thought home-ownership or the typical white-picket-fence, American dream was possible for me, but Portugal is a stable, modern country that has affordable real estate in areas that I would be interested in. I'm almost fluent in Spanish and am teaching myself continental Portuguese now in preparation.

I appreciate any help or advice anyone can give me! Thank you!"

I was born in England and lived there for 9 years, then moved to Canada. I’d like to go back for undergrad and stay there. I would like advice on how to handle the cost of being an international student, as it is really expensive and the way that loans work is really confusing. I’m in Ontario, if that is relevant, and I have really good grades so I know I’ll get in, it’s just the money that is worrying. I’m really lucky that my parents have stable jobs with good salaries, but that means that I can’t get too much financial assistance from the government. I believe you can get loans from the federal and provincial governments, but these barely cover the tuition fees, and I could work a bit in the year but mostly only summers. I read somewhere on the uk governments website that if you lived there for more than 7 years you can get loans from them? Everywhere else it says you can’t so if you know if this is true or not that would be great. I’m quite at a loss of what to do about this, if anyone has advice about bank loans, or if I should just stay here for undergrad and then move as it’s so much cheaper. Or just how you live with this sort of debt and how you’re paying it off. Ask for more details if you need! 
P.S. Edited to say that I’m a dual citizen and have both passports, so no visa required, right?"

I am currently in the process of obtaining Romanian citizenship (by descent). I’m technically already a citizen and all I have to do now is go to the nearest Romanian consulate and apply for my passport. I literally had plans to do this final step right before COVID-19 hit, now it seems like I’ll have to wait a few months (and then another few months for the passport to arrive). 

I’ve always wanted to live in Europe, my boyfriend is Italian, and I don’t have strong family or cultural ties to the US. I am sick of the US at this point. Also, I am tired of visiting him and his family and having a countdown until my 90 day tourist stay is over and I have to leave again and can’t return until a few months pass. 

English is my native language, I’m fairly good with Italian (maybe B2), know some Spanish and Portuguese, but almost zero Romanian. 

As for my career path, I’m currently unemployed (as I just graduated) and I have a degree in biotechnology. This isn’t really my passion and I’d like to do something design related (UX/UI, photography). I’m taking time right now to really figure out what I want to do but I KNOW Europe is in my near future. 

The questions I have are:

1.	Once I get my Romanian passport, what’s next? I don’t want to live in Romania and would prefer to avoid the bureaucracy there. 

2.	Does having Romanian citizenship mean I can stay anywhere in the EU for an indefinite amount of time, with or without a job? My research has shown me that some/all EU countries will only allow you to stay for 3 months if you don’t have a job there. If this is true, would I be able to move to another country (not Romania) after those 3 months are over?

3.	Does having Romanian citizenship give me access to free health insurance and care throughout the EU, even while traveling?

4.	Where would I get my European Health insurance card? I don’t have any residence in Romania but I have family there if I need to use their address and declare residency. 

5.	Where would be the best place to find jobs in biotechnology with a bachelor’s degree? Somewhere similar to San Francisco, CA, in terms of volume of companies?

Furthermore, I want to actually study something that will lead me to a job. I don't really know beyond a surface level which countries' economies (of the two) are in need of what profession.

Ideally, I either want to study psychology or philosophy-- psychology is much more practical and widely applicable, but I also have a great passion for philosophy. If I were to study philosophy, the goal would likely to pursue a career in academia (and a respective PhD). My current \~rough\~ plan is to move when I finish my undergraduate degree and obtain a Master's at very LEAST in whatever I study, but beyond that, I need some guidance. And are there things I should know before trying to expatriate as a student? Any feedback is appreciated!

Edit: My German skills are roughly around an A2 right now, but I'm taking German classes/studying on my own to become proficient before I graduate.

Another edit: Perhaps my real contradiction is that I want to live abroad and work a stable job, yet the fields that interest me don't even offer me stability in my own country. I am quite the idealist I think, but I unfortunately know that careers in academia are extremely unstable."

In terms of climate I want hot weather year round and very warm water, don’t care that much if it rains a lot or not. I strongly prefer a more rainforest type environment to a desert one. I’d love to see some mountains and not flat terrain.

So far I’ve been mostly considering Medellín (even without the beach if i can figure out traveling to one either in a nearby county or back to my home town between semesters I’d consider it), somewhere in Mexico (maybe Puerto Vallarta?), and Puerto Rico (not so cheap with university prices though as part of US)

This has been a discussion my wife and I have been having for some time now. First, here's some info about us:

**Citizenship**: U.S. for both

**Current Location**: Midwest USA

**Age**: 26 for both

**Education**: For both of us, BA in Graphic Design from state universities

**Profession**: Both graphic designers at different departments in state universities. 4+ years experience in in-house design shops and design agencies. Experience in UI/UX and print+animation design for me, and branding and print+web marketing for my wife. She also has experience illustrating.

**Language**: **English** (native!) **German** (just for me, not my wife) Open to learning any other languages

**Budget**: We're open to anything. We currently make 100k combined per year and after expenses we're putting quite a bit away in savings per month. We don't have kids either.

We've both been very concerned about the state of affairs in this country.

I'm not wanting to leave that urgently (maybe sometime in the next few years, though obviously the sooner the better). I'm also quite aware the world might look very different after all this is over. I'm just looking for the most up-to-date advice and info you might be able to offer.

**Educational background:**

* Currently a final-year medical student in Australia. I plan to complete my internship in Australia in 2021, which will get me the bare-minimum general license needed to practice as a doctor (= junior hospital doctor, not independent GP/PCP, at least in Australia). 
* Already have a Bachelor's with Honours in biomedical sciences, which qualifies me for some junior biomedical lab roles e.g. technician or research assistant. I'd also be able to apply for PhD positions, as iirc the Honours year is equivalent to a Master's in Australia.
* Previously did an exchange semester in Norway but had to cut it short after \~4 months due to a family emergency.

**Work experience:**

Nothing full-time. Only part-time tutoring, lab work, and pharmacy retail.

**Some more info:**

I would be willing to work in Norway as a doctor (both clinical and non-clinical roles) or in biomedical research, or become a PhD student.

I am willing to work hard learning Norwegian. My partial exchange semester gave me a bit of a start, and I've been looking into online classes recently since the lockdown started. I have heard about some of the 'downsides' of the culture in Norway re: fitting in and making friends, and tbh I feel like it actually all suits my personality pretty well, so it's not a huge problem for me, though I'm sure there's some rose-tinted glasses involved in that perception.

I am female, East Asian, and bisexual, in case discrimination is an issue. That said, I personally didn't feel it was at all while I was in Norway - if anything I felt I faced way less discrimination there than I do home in good old Oz! I don't know all the details of the political situation or the general public's perceptions in Norway, though.

I'm single and childless, and it'll probably stay that way for a while (certainly the childless part!). However, my mother would possibly be interested in eventually migrating to Norway with me. She's in her late 50s and currently works in telemarketing, although I imagine she would be looking to retire by the time I possibly make it to Norway.

I was in Oslo for exchange and I found the weather fine - the only part I really disliked much was when it rained a lot (so maybe Bergen is further down my preferred list of places lol).

**Questions:**

* What's the procedure I would have to go through to move to Norway?
* What parts of Norway should I be looking at? 
* Would it be better for me to try to migrate as a worker or as a student?
* Is it possible to apply for specialty training in Norway as a non-EU foreign doctor? If so, how difficult is it? I'm trying to toss up between moving to Norway ASAP vs finishing my specialty training in Australia (another 4-6 years on top of the internship), but being able to do my training in Norway would neatly solve that problem.
* What types of doctors are most in demand in Norway? I'm mainly interested in general practice/primary care, radiology, or pathology.
* What is biomedical research like in Norway? The most popular research fields, work conditions, job security, required qualifications, roles with highest demand, etc.
* What are the possibilities for my mother joining me in Norway?
* Any other advice or resources you could offer?"

I’m interested in the working holiday visa program in Ireland, and meet all of the eligibility requirements. I visited Ireland for the first time last year and absolutely fell in love with it. I have some relatives in Ireland, but none that would qualify me for dual citizenship. While I would be open to the prospect of moving abroad in a more permanent capacity, I think the working holiday time frame would be a good fit for me right now.

I have some savings to give me time before finding a job in Ireland, but couldn’t stretch more than a few months without working. My main concern is finding a job. I love Galway and other places in the West/Southern portion of Ireland that I’ve visited, but I’d imagine Dublin has the most realistic job prospects. I am hoping to find a job that’s at least somewhat relevant to my field. 

Is it possible to find a job even loosely related to public policy/public affairs/international affairs/political science in Ireland on a working holiday visa? 

Has anyone had any experience with this visa, in general? 

I’d also be going alone, so I’d be interested to hear any takes on meeting people as an American moving to Ireland alone! Or really any advice on moving to Ireland in general.

I still hope to make the trip when things clear up. The trouble is that time is not on my side. The application for the VISA states that you must be 35 or less at the time of application, and I'll be turning 36 early June. Currently the German Consolute which processes these visas has ceased to do so according to their website (it has understandbly been deemed a non-essential service). Another issue is that while Canada has a travel advisory against all non-essential travel, it becomes impossible to obtain travel health insurance (since every policy states that coverage is not provided if the policy was purchased after a non-essential travel ban had been implemented). A component of the visa application is to provide proof of coverage. 

It seems like my window of opportunity to obtain this particular visa is slipping away and there's nothing I can do about it. Is my only hope that German consolate begins to process visas again, and that Canada lifts the travel advisory? Should I just submit an application now anyway, while I'm still 35, stating my intention to travel when safe, and an intention to buy travel health insurance when possible (even though PROOF of both flight tickets and insurance is required)?

Most jobs are offering me 50,000 GDP when I currently make 120,000 USD. While people keep telling me the cost of living is different, so far I haven't noticed it.

We also really like Belgium, but I can find very little information on geotechnical salaries and it seems like there are a lot fewer positions. A couple years ago, my wife was offered a position in Ghent, but I wanted her to turn it down and I immediately regretted it. Ghent is one of my favorite cities but, while she speaks Dutch (and French), I do not. *BTW, she is a museum curator, and they are not often considered ""skilled"" workers eligible for visas.*

However, here are my questions. I apologize if they seem rudimentary.
First, I am married, and my husband would not be joining me if I were to pursue my degree abroad.

Would this have an impact on any financial or legal requirements (i.e., minimum income requirements, etc.?) 

Second, would my age be an issue if acquiring a student visa, or perhaps a count against me if I apply for schools? I know this may be hard to answer definitely, but any experiences are welcome.

My age and profession aren't relevant because I know I qualify, but I'm having trouble with the process. 
TLDR: What documents do I need and where do I request them from and what form do they have to be in? (Official, unofficial? I've heard of lots of different types besides that) I'm going through my great-grandpa, to grandpa, to dad, to me. 

I'm really having trouble with this whole process. It's so confusing. I'm an American trying to get italian dual citizenship through descent. I know I qualify, but the process of getting the right documents is difficult. It takes a few months to get an appointment with a consulate and I'd have to take a trip to go there (within the US but still), and if I don't have the right documents upon that appointment I'll have to schedule another appointment which would mean more time and money.

 I know I need to request naturalization records and I know how to do that, through the USCIS. But I'm not sure how to get my great-grandpas original birth certificate from Italy. On some documents it says he was from refrancore, and some from alessandria, so I'm assuming he moved at one point and was born in one of those two places.
 I'm assuming I'd have to request his birth certificate from some organization in those towns but I don't know which. I've also heard that some consulates will require you have the documents of people not even related to your line of descent but just married to the people in your line of descent. For me it goes great-grandpa, grandpa, dad, me. Some of the women in that line and on my mom's side are Italian too, but I don't want to get documents that I don't need since its expensive.  I think it will make it easier that I'm going through all men because the surname stays the same. Do you think they will require documents of any of the women in my line? I've heard that certain marriage certificates are required, but it's apparently different for different consulates which I don't understand. There aren't any divorces in my line that I know of.

I was planning to get a Medical Science degree there and planning to apply in a medical school after that.

if you got other country options (Australia/NZ/EU/US, etc. anything), I would be more than happy to hear!!

I'm finishing my Bachelors in Chemistry this spring and weighing my options in a changing world. I was going to just work in industry but now the economy is uncertain. Seeing the US's response to the pandemic has revealed to me that US domestic policy is not just inconvenient, as I previously thought, it's dangerous. I want to apply to do a PhD in Denmark.

I have plenty of undergraduate research experience, two poster credits, and maybe a publication within the next year, all in inorganic synthesis. I have a friend who is a resident in Denmark doing med school. Here is my plan as of now:

Accept job I don't want that pays well from my current university for a year while saving money.

Use the money to travel to Denmark for a few months, staying with my friend and visiting schools/interviewing professors. 

Make the decision on which PhD programs to apply to and send out my applications.

All the while taking online language courses/discording with my danish friend and his pals.

Goal: PhD & permanent residence.

Language: English, 2yr. university french.

Work Skills: B.Sc. in Chemistry. 
3years undergrad research with electrochemistry, Shlenk techniques, inorganic synthesis and characterization. 
1 year as a laboratory teaching assistant.
4 years worked in lab management/maintenance for the teaching labs.

Problems: medical & student debt, 2.7 GPA

Questions: Do Danish PhD schools automatically dismiss <3.0GPAs like American ones? Should I wait until I have publication credits? Does it increase my chances/is there a need to visit the colleges and profs before starting the application process? Does anyone know the differences between the US and Danish PhD application process as far as letters, interviews, exams? 

Misconceptions(?):
I'm aware that in the Danish system the research proposal is due up front as part of the application and is usually guided by the PI you are interested in. I'm also aware that the stipend for a PhD is anywhere from 20k DKK to 25k DKK with a ~40% danish tax and also US taxes. I'm used to living in poverty so the stipend/cost-of-living ratio doesn't matter as much to me, but I will have about 500 USD in payments per month to make on debt."

I had to drop out for personal reasons, and my transcript is looking quite rough there as well. I’m wondering what information I would need to provide a Spanish university for them to consider my enrollment. 

I am open to both public and private universities, and I’m also wondering if it is possible to begin midyear between semesters(like around January 2021)."

I have worked in several government national projects. I have 2,5 years of experience in Bridge Design & Building Design but held no Professional Engineer accreditation ( i worked as an assistant of Engineer).

this semester (if everything goes well) will be the last semester of my study period here. earlier I planned to work here in an Engineering firm, but as usual, language is the problem here. I can hold a daily conversation in german, but to work in an Engineering firm, some colloquial and specialized terms are needed, and it is hard to find this kind of language course.

I also have a high interest in academic positions. I always cherish the time of working on my master theses. Research and experiment is something that I really enjoyed. the problem is my university is just a small university with a limited amount of funds available therefore less academic position available. I also think that it is not a time to do a Ph.D. since I am thinking that I am not in that level of dedication yet. I still had to be supervised during my master theses. but in the end, a Ph.D. would be my goal.

So I am thinking if I could move to one of the countries that I mentioned above the plan is (except Canada) to migrate there for an engineering form job. I have checked the official web ( [https://skillshortages.immigration.govt.nz/](https://skillshortages.immigration.govt.nz/) ) and I find that structural engineers are needed in NZ at the provincial/national level. the same case I also found in the UK, any Civil Engineering Jobs are listed as needed at the national level ( [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-k-shortage-occupation-list](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-k-shortage-occupation-list) ). I found a lot of job-advertisement on LinkedIn for both Countries. do you think it is worth the time to apply for a job from LinkedIn? and what do you think of my plan (what should i prepare, any tips, etc.)

For Canada, I am planning to do MAsc Degree there, which is a master's degree with heavy research orientation. I have made a shortlist of professors that i want to work with from several universities, and i am currently reading their publications (thanks for social distancing) since i need a supervisor acceptance before I can apply to University officially. the University that i am interested is Uni Waterloo, Uni Dalhousie, and Uni Manitoba. i also planned to work as part-time assistant in engineering firm when i am there, but it is not a priority. i am thinking this step since my master's degree relies heavily on exams and courses but the portion of research only 20% of the program. i think by doing master degree in research would help me later in P.hD level. my question in this plan is do you think that if I have a master degree already it would increase my acceptance possibility into these master programs? since i have 1 published article, not in top journal but i think pretty decent for master level.

TL,DR : a master's's degree of civil engineering student in Germany with some professional experience, looking for job in UK and NZ , or go to Canada for another master degree with research in structural engineering in order to prepare for my P.hD later. interested in either Academic or Industrial Position, looking for suggestions and tips."

I'm looking to expand my international experience and get somewhere warm; specifically choosing Bahrain since I was born there (moved to Canada when I was 6).

I'm just not sure how I would be able to make the connection/application to one of their companies - and what else I'd need in support of that application.

* am a registered Professional Engineer in Alberta
* have a Security+ certification (expiring December)
* am first aid, CPR, and H2S certified

Hey all,  
I spent two years in Scotland and 1 year in Ireland on youth mobility visas. I feel more at home really anywhere in Europe than I ever have in Canada.

I'm back in Canada and miserable. I'd like to make the move in a more permanent way and I'm quite open to most countries in Europe. As we all know, work visas aren't easy to come by. And sadly there is no ancestry visa for me.

So here's what I've got. No university degree, English is my only fluent language. Have been working as a digital marketer and content writer for about 5 years. I taught myself programming years ago and I know my best shot would be getting back into it, but I definitely want to look at other options first.

Are there any countries where I'd have some kind of hope of getting a work visa in community management/digital marketing/writing? Any careers besides programming that I could teach myself and increase my chances? I'm learning video editing as a hobby, but I can't imagine that would be of much help."

I am simply wondering what the prospects for getting out of this country are given my future skillset.

I am a 19M looking to move to Europe when I get out of college, be that out of undergrad ('23) or graduate school (so, '25 with an MA or later if a PhD). My reasons for doing so are simply that I find the United States completely insufferable, I am somewhat disgusted by the American mentality of my compatriots and would simply like to leave. I am also attracted to Europe for architectural, historical, linguistic, cultural, religious etc. reasons, having loved to travel there.

I have studied French and German, both to the B2 level, and am beginning to study Italian, primarily because countries that speak those languages would be preferable. I would highly prefer a more central location, like Northern Italy, Austria, Bavaria, France, and (most high on my list but I assume the least possible) Switzerland.

But here's the kicker: I am not an engineer. I am currently acquiring a degree in Classics (Latin and Ancient Greek), Philosophy, and Sanskrit, and have dreams of becoming a professor. I can say with absolute certainty that teaching philosophy/classics at a university in one of the places mentioned above would be a lifelong dream come true. However, I understand that it is quite difficult to find a job in academia even in the US. I suppose applying for jobs on both continents would increase my chances of landing even one interview, but obviously the chances are low anywhere.

One thing that could increase my chances in this regard is getting a terminal degree at a European university. I am currently working extremely hard in (my top 15) school to maintain my GPA, participate in the honors program, do research, etc. in order to maximize my chances for securing admission at a decent European school.

I am, however, content to teach at a lower level if I can get into Europe. Latin comes to mind, and I know it's taught at a lot of European schools.

Finally, this is titled West/Central Europe, but I will consider anything. 

Any advice? Feel free to ridicule me - I understand this is all very hopeful and probably a bit unrealistic. I do, however, want to escape the cultural cesspit of the US."

I'm a 19 year old, first year nursing school student. For a long time, I've wanted to move to the UK. I want to move there permanently, in fact! I have people I care about very much there, and I feel like I would be most happy getting there as soon as possible.

I am aware that pay isn't as good for nurses there, but I am willing to accept that and I'm not in it for the money. All I care about is getting there and getting out of here. I really don't have an attachment to my location and have a deep dislike for my university that I'm at. 

But... I've got some advantages and disadvantages with this. I know there's a high demand for nurses in the UK, but getting certified there seems to be a pain. I was hoping that studying abroad there, or even better, transferring there, would make getting qualified to work there a quicker, better process- not to mention being able to stay there while I go to school!

The only problem is making it affordable. While I hate the university I'm at and am arguably pretty depressed there, I'm going practically for free and with little to no worries of debt. On the other hand, I know studying abroad is expensive, especially in the UK. I don't come from a rich family, and we don't have that much money. I've heard paying back student loans is much more forgiving in England than in America, which is great, but I doubt it'd benefit me at all, considering I'm still a US citizen and wouldn't be able to borrow anything from there, even with full intent of living and working in the UK.

Does anyone have any advice as to how to, affordably, transfer to the United Kingdom or at least study abroad as a nursing student there without having to borrow enough student loans from the US to cripple me for the rest of my life? Any scholarship programs or universities, any at all, that could help me out? I'm a generally impressive student and am in the honors college at my current university, so maybe that will help?

So I decided to study there, but the information in internet is very scarce. Any uruguayan here to help me out? I aim studying economics. My spanish is average and I can hold conversations.

My plan is to move there in july to set myself, find a job and a place to rent and become legal. Also, I've been working since january to gather money for that plan."

My background:

25F single, 2.5-3 years of work experience in UIUX/Project Management space for large Tech company in DC area. Dual citizenship in Canada and US

I’ve been here for about 3 years and am getting the vibe that the work culture isn’t for me - also having adhd has made it super hard. My family lives in a different state and we are not very close (immigrants and we’ve moved around a lot)

I’ve lived for half year in Hong Kong and Europe (Prague) before and wasn’t a huge fan of the cold in Europe though I could deal with it

I’ve got a great career here in the states but I’ve got major Wunderlist and really want an adventure while I’m still young - but idk if I’m crazy to potentially take a pay cut or fall back on my career. I’ve got around 80K saved up/in assets

Considering London, Berlin but curious where else folks would suggest going. It is important I continue doing corporate :)

I also have the option of doing a working holiday visa to many countries through Canada!"

I would like to move to Europe in the next six months to a year (assuming travel restrictions are lifted). I began considering living abroad high school, and later studied abroad in Prague. While there I traveled around a fair amount, so I think I’ve got at least an idea of what I’m getting myself into. I have no return timetable in mind at this time. Mainly I’m just wondering how to get started! Any resources, guides, or advice is appreciated.

Here's some info about me:

**Citizenship**: U.S.

**Current Location**: Bay Area, CA

**Age**: 23

**Sex**: Male

**Education**: B.A. in Cinema Studies, Minors in Producing and Business of Entertainment; Open to earning a graduate degree; Open to apprenticeship/learning a trade

**Profession**: N/A, recent graduate; internship experience with Hollywood development studio, talent agencies, presidential campaign

**Destination Country**: Europe, ideally Italy, in or near a cosmopolitan city (e.g. Milan, London, Amsterdam)

**Language**: English (native); 1 semester of Italian (lmao); willing to learn a new language

**Budget**: $15k-20k (assuming I can sell my car)

**Concerns**: Job availability, housing options, access to mental healthcare, immigration and visa logistics, my boyish naiveté

**Reasons For Moving**: It’s time for a change of scenery and a chance to gain new perspectives. I’ve been craving an adventure and, after moving away from New York City, can’t seem to get excited about living anywhere else in the U.S. I’ve also become quite burnt out in regard to my field. I sincerely miss my time in Europe and have always toyed with the idea of moving there. Toss in some personal stuff, and now seems to be the perfect time to go.

**Job Search**: I believe I am capable of teaching English should I find such an opportunity. I haven't yet investigated anything thoroughly, though a company at which I interned in 2018 has an office in London. I’m guessing that this is going to be a variable influenced by location/citizenship.

**Side Note**: I am possibly eligible for Romanian citizenship by descent, and for Austrian citizenship by declaration. Is a viable way to get around obtaining a visa, etc? I’ve begun acquiring the requisite documents for both applications.

**TL;DR**: What are some guides/resources I can use to start planning a move to Europe as a recent graduate? Any tips or advice is appreciated."

I have difficulties finding a job since so I went to Australia May 2018-Feb 2019 but I wound up with a gambling addiction at the casinos there. I came back to HK Feb 2019 and worked for a whole year as a bartender to try to get my net worth up again. 

Because I know I cannot really do anything with this degree, I am thinking about doing a second Bachelor in something concrete like accounting or business administration (I have found one uni in Lithuania and one uni in Estonia offering these programmes respectively for an affordable price). It just feels like something I want to accomplish because I really am not good at anything else and I really want to attain a mastery level in something technical.

Germany seems to be a more straightforward choice. I can stick with the lane  of American Studies In prestigious universities there. I am also considering instead to do a MA in English so I can teach tertiary-level academic English as an instructor at community colleges let’s say as an example.

I’m also thinking of doing just a TESOL and then just fly around and start teaching English in different locations. But I don’t know how hard is it to get placements.

I really don’t know which way is the way to go. I also thought about computer science but I had like 15 lessons on YouTube about the basics. I don’t think I can remember any of them now but I just think it’s kind of hard for me.

My net worth is 20k"

Background Current Situation:

\- Also did my A levels in the UK  
\- Currently in the UK on a Working Holiday Visa (Tier 5) which will expire in December 2021  
\- For various reasons I do not have internship or any work experiences (currently unemployed too) but will be willing to put effort into that  
\- Career goal wise, I am considering combining my skills I learn from my Economics degree with tech skills to pursue a Data Analytics/Data Science career, or a full transition into the tech industry  
\- Current plan: self-learn technical skills (Python/SQL) and work on personal projects while working part time until summer 2021, when I will prepare for a masters degree in Statistics / relevant masters degree

To expand on my last two points, the reason why I am considering this is because I want to gain a Tier 2 general working visa towards the end of my masters degree. But I am not sure the job demand in this career path will be sufficiently high to help with my application.

So I would like some suggestions and opinions from you guys on what else I could be working on, or what other options in the rest of Europe that I could consider for a stronger application for residency/citizenship and a good career progression.

I prefer nordic countries, but I'm open to different opportunities. I've already applied to Copenaghen Business School and Aarhus University. I'm not very confident about the first one and Aarhus already rejected my application.

I don't know where should I search some advice so I tried here.

Thanks"

I can't afford flights really anywhere outside of North America, and wherever I end up needs to be as cheap as possible. I don't care about safety or any of that.

I'm more or less taking a gamble on this. It's not really for pleasure or fun, I just want to leave this life behind and start elsewhere.

My current job title is Tech Lead. I am focused on full stack development with Node, PHP, React and Vue.

Over the last year I've been try to secure a job with visa sponsorship in above countries. I've applied more than 200 positions via LinkedIn, [indeed.com](https://indeed.com) and other job boards. I tried with [talent.io](https://talent.io), hackajob and other various developer showcase websites as well as some recruitment companies. Sadly I have not got any opportunity yet.

When I'm applying to a company and if I'm not selected, I usually don't go with that company again. Sometimes they mention that they'll be in touch if there are any suitable positions (Sometimes I see the same position I applied kept opening even after 3, 4 months). But I feel if I keep applying to a same company again and again it seems like I'm spamming or being impolite.

Usually what happened was when I applied to a certain position mostly I didn't get any response. Sometimes I got rejection mail telling that they went with someone bit better. Very rarely I was invited to  a take home assessment or a quiz, where I did it with all my effort, still no response or got rejected.

I rewrote my CV multiple times with every detail but seems like I'm going nowhere. I even tried with applying to positions below me which requires 3, 4 years of experience but no luck. I got no interview invitations with any of the developer showcase websites, which made me feel like giving up.

When mentioning salary expectations it was always the average, never more.

I understand that hiring someone overseas and providing a work visa sponsorship / relocation assistance is something that a company must do with a care and caution. But for me it seems like something impossible.

Can someone clarify/validate following things for me?

1. Is it OK to keep applying to the same company / same position in same company even if you got rejected?
2. What are the factors in CV that will make a recruiter wants to hire a certain person?
3. How can I improve my self / CV to be more attractive
4. General advice to be improved."

I've looked at the ""skilled visa"" options for other countries like New Zealand and Canada and they'd seem to ding me pretty hard for not having a college degree.

Looks like the only options that are viable are the ""work visa"" types where a company sponsors you and you get to live there temporarily while you're working for them. I'd be willing to do that, especially if there was some path to residency/citizenship.

I never did study abroad during school, so now I really want to work outside America for at least a year before coming back and starting my career in the States.

Based on my experiences here, I'm considering trying to leave the country after I graduate for someplace with a better social safety net (especially healthcare). I currently have a bachelors and a non-terminal Masters in English as well.

Based on prior research, it seems almost certain I'd need to either get a postdoc in my field somewhere or retrain into an entirely new industry that is in high demand through a master's program. I'd be willing to do either. Somewhat tempted by temporary ""teach English abroad"" positions, but feeling a bit overwhelmed about how to get the proper credentials for them (i.e. TOEFL, TESOL).

Budget: I will likely graduate with between 15 and 30k savings depending on how aggressively I save over the next year.
Citizenships: Only US. I have no family abroad going back three generations, so claiming legacy citizenship anywhere unlikely.
Weather: I don't mind cold and dark and would prefer 4 distinct seasons if at all possible.
Language: Stale reading proficiency Spanish and French. Very basic conversational Korean. Would readily learn a new language or improve one I've already studied.

My current list is Canada or Germany via school or South Korea via a teach abroad program. I like the idea of someplace like Ireland or Scotland but research says they would be almost impossible to get into for someone with my background. I'm also feeling constricted by being queer and only finding so many places friendly to that - South Korea seems like a mixed bag on that front. More than anything, I'd like to go someplace and settle for a while rather than doing the digital nomad thing and bouncing around to different places every few months/years.

Questions:
- Any particular fields worth training into through a Master's that would be in high demand in Canada or Germany?
- Any reputable teach abroad programs in East Asia beyond South Korea? Any chance of these opening the door for something more permanent, or is it almost always a 1 or 2 year thing at most?
- Any other locations or options available to someone in my background? I understand literary degrees are highly specialized and often count for little outside academia, just asking.
- Unrelated: is there any country that would accept someone living there for an extended period who makes their living primarily online (such as online tutoring)? I imagine not, but again, thought I'd ask.

And yes, I realize there is a pandemic on and that the long-running economic ripple effects of this will make moving abroad very difficult in the near future. You don't have to tell me twice."

TL;DR: Is there a Minimum-stay requirement for Portugal’s permanent resident permit?

_________________

(I can’t find any reliable online source for my question. Aside from straight up calling a Portuguese embassy, I figured I’d first ask Reddit.)

I’d like to move to Portugal and get a long-stay self-employment visa that I plan to continually renew until I’m eligible to become a permanent resident. 

I read online that one qualifies for permanent residency in Portugal after five yearsand citizenship after six years. You just have to show evidence of sufficient income, pass an exam proving basic Portuguese proficiency, and probably a few other things, but is there a “minimum-stay” requirement? 

Some articles report you can’t leave for more than three months during the entire five-year period, which would make me feel trapped because I travel frequently for several months at a time. Other articles say you just need to show proof you’ve had a home in Portugal the entire five years. And two or three said there was no minimum-stay requirement at all. So I’m a bit confused here.
 
For example, if I leave for six months every year while maintaining my home there (despite not being physically present in the country), would that disqualify me from permanent residency or citizenship when I try to apply?

Also, has any non-EU citizen here already gone through the process of becoming a permanent Portugal resident or citizen? If so, what was your experience like?"

Hello,  i've posted here a while ago, but now i have a clearer objective.  
I'm   currently in a equivalent to an Undergrad\* in Linguistics, and i  intend  to specialize in Translation, but i am poor, and have issues  with my  country's political and economical situation. I wish to pursue  higher  education, and to get my english and german (eventually) to  C1-C2, and a  better quality of life overall. I also wish a colder  country, not a big  fan of the tropical heat. The sole things i know i  have going for me  (wether they hold significant value or not), is that  i'm young, working  my way to be Tri-lingual (Portuguese, English and  German), and  academically, a good record (high-ish grades, self taught  english, which  has been praised by 2 natives from the USA peers in my  university, and  though not as relevant, i've also been diagnosed as  being gifted in  linguistics skills, which made me an interesting person  for the director  of CAPA). Socially i also have a good record, but i  don't think this is  relevant info. Work wise, i taught for a short  time, and will start  working as a translator for scientific articles,  at CAPA.

My  main interest (more  like my main idea, based on all the possibilities i  don't know of yet)  are higher education grants/scholarships/programs,  but the system is  confusing for me. Both peers mentioned told me i  qualify for some, and  that i stood a decent chance of getting them if i  tried (one of them  was here on a Fullbright, the other is the Director  of CAPA, Ron  Martinez).  
Any german speaking country works too. (put this here because of title restrictions)  


Thanks for any responses, and for reading all of this.

\*=   In Brazil we don't use that system, my degree goes over linguistics,   translation (theory and practice), and literature (both local and   european), and at the end of its 4 years it would count as a Bachelors   degree elsewhere. For curiosity's sake, i can better explain the Letras   degree if needed so."

I've always been interested in other countries and languages since I was younger with the hope of one day living abroad. I studied abroad for 6 months in high school in Russia however was assaulted by a classmate I was tutoring in English so the program I was with quickly sent me home. Even with that negative experience under my belt, I have still wanted to go abroad!

Background: I graduated about a year ago from a US-college with a degree in Mathematics (well Actuarial Science, however, most people don't understand what that entails) and currently am working a no-mind job as a QA/QC analyst for a Tech firm while studying for a Master's degree in Cybersecurity. I've never quite liked the tech life but it was what I was good at and it paid well. My boyfriend has decided to move along with me when he is able to as he unfortunately lost the only family he really had - his mother - to cancer this past year. He has a BA in Television/Media and has been working as a Video Engineer in the Sports Industry so his job doesn't really seem like it would be a job that he could find easily in the international market - especially considering he speaks poor high-school Spanish at best lmao.

We wouldn't mind looking into any country - I speak Russian quite well still and was taught Spanish and Chinese all the way through university and was even considering doing CELTA testing. The only heritage that we might be able to say we have is that my boyfriend's grandparents/great-grandparents were from the Czech Republic and my father is from Guyana with my grandmother being from Portugal and grandfather being from China (thus I hold a Chinese last name - not sure if this changes anything). I was just wondering what the best routes would be - I worry about COVID-19 and any sort of changes that would be made now or which are safe (there's a lot of worry where I live now). I worry about what countries I could have a reasonable wage to live on without having to put it a ton of work (more than 50 hours a week..) or about having the ability to visit my mother once a year as she is about the only family I have left so this would have to be factored into pay as well. I also worry about the CELTA courses abroad as I would hate to spend so much money into just getting there - airfare + courses seems so expensive (I am a very cheap person so I might just be dramatic haha).

TL:DR: As you can tell I have so many questions and am honestly so ready to jump and do it but I keep coming up with what-if's and questions."

I am not sure about my budget right now but I am assuming that it will be under $20,000.

I am looking for any information about if other countries offer job openings to work abroad for this career. I really like tropical weather so I included South America but I went to Amsterdam last summer and loved it. So, Europe is fine with me as well!

I want to try and maybe get citizenships eventually with the country that allows me to work there with a work visa.

Does anyone know how I can find out if this is possible and what countries have a need for this type of work?

I appreciate any information and help!!"

I've been wanting to leave the US since I was in grad school during Trump's election. Now I've been working as a genetic counselor/genetic specialist for about 2 years, master's degree, certified by ABGC. Fiance has been working as a software engineer for 3 years and spent his senior year of college as an intern with the same company. He has a bachelor's.

I prefer a country with English as a common language, better work-life balance, general respect for human beings, and better healthcare system. My fiance would be open to Japan and Scandinavian countries as well, although I probably wouldn't be able to work in my current job in non-English countries as it involves talking to patients directly. Even with learning a new language, learning the medical aspect of that language would be an additional challenge. I could potentially work for genetic testing companies as a medical science liaison, though.

Education system is not \*as\* important to us as we do not plan on having children.

I am pretty cold-intolerant, but I can deal with it if needed. I spent a semester studying abroad in England back in 2013 and LOVED it there. Loved Ireland and Scotland as well. Was not a huge fan of Paris. Fiance has never been out of the US. Neither of us have been to Canada. We are honeymoon-ing in Japan in fall 2021 (hopefully).

We have no known immediate family in any country outside of the US.

I'd love info on timelines, where to find positions willing to sponsor visas, if student loan debt is something that will limit our options, etc. Destinations I hadn't considered are also welcome.

In Canada our NOCs are 4153/3111 and 2173, not sure how useful that info is!"

I graduated medical school last year but I’ve taken a gap year before internship for mental health reasons. All I have is my MBBS with no actual clinical practice experience.

Guyana recently became the next oil global oil giant but because of heavy corruption, our government screwed us over with royalties from Exxon. Additionally, there’s a lot of election fraud occurring right now which is further exacerbating the racial division in my country. As if that wasn’t bad enough, there’s mass hysteria over a recently confirmed COVID-19 case.

Our motto is, “One People, One Nation, One Destiny”, but living here has shown me that it’s anything but that. Taxes are exorbitant with no tangible improvement in quality of life, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, the pay for medical professionals is a joke, racism is prevalent, corruption is a part of everyday life. I could go on and on but I’d just end up getting frustrated.

I’ve always admired the European nations. Bulk of them are agnostic-atheist, like myself. You see your money making a difference in the country. Education is encouraged. My only concern is the racial discrimination but I’ll find that anywhere I go. I don’t know how relevant this is but there’s some pictures of my appearance on my reddit.

Anyway, I’m broke af so anything like a scholarship to further continuing my studies would be preferable. It doesn’t have to be clinical practice or even anything medicine related. I have no issue learning the country’s language and adjusting to their customs and societal norm since it shouldn’t be too different from my home country. I just want out.

Your feedback is very much appreciated!"

We are leaning towards leaving the country once I graduate, but I know this is a big jump so other states within the US as a stepping stone are okay too. However, we would like to move abroad eventually. Universal healthcare, or even just affordable healthcare, is very important to us, as well as government commitment to a sustainable future. I would like to stay away from areas with tornadoes and big thunderstorms, and prefer more temperate climates because I can't handle cold temperatures, and he struggles with super hot temperatures. I intend to pursue a PhD in sustainable development after I gain some work experience, so a country with work in this field would be helpful.

I have intermediate knowledge of Japanese and intend to take the JLPT N2 this December, and beginner knowledge of Korean. We are willing to learn another language. I know teaching English is popular in both of these countries, and I am not opposed, but many of the programs I've seen don't accommodate more than single people.

I just need ideas. I'm aware this is a lot of qualifiers but at this point I'm willing to compromise on most except for the tornadoes and routine severe thunderstorms. They terrify me. Yes I'm aware that I live in Alabama.

My husband heard from a number of companies that would love to hire him if he became a citizen first (due to the costs of hiring a non-citizen).

With this new election come around, we're faced again with all the things this country desperately needs and what it's looking like will take decades to get to. My husband works with a colleague who is from overseas (and who my husband talked with last election) who said he could put in a word for him with people at Cambridge.

It's daunting. I know the UK's politics are looking similar to ours right now. And I don't know how much  of what I feel is grass-is-greener syndrome. National healthcare, slightly fewer working hours, and more vacation time could a be a huge boon to our quality of life (I'd could make an exponentially longer list but I'll spare us the time).

It's likely telling the guy to put in a word leads to nothing, but at the same time, I'd hate for it to go somewhere and then we turn it down because we're not sure.

If you think my reasons for wanting to leave are stupid and that America is the greatest, then kindly don't bother commenting. We clearly won't understand each other and arguing that I shouldn't want to leave wastes both my time and yours.

We are **not** opposed to learning a new language but feel an English speaking country would help with adjusting. My husband works for a state university and does not make as much money as a computer programmer normally would in the US, so we don't think a pay cut from US norms would be a big issue. I do however worry about getting myself a job once/if my husband finds one.

I recognize that getting a visa to work in and move to a new country is difficult. I'm just looking for suggestions for narrowing down the field of where to apply for work / visit."

I finished high school with good marks and completed a year (so far) at a university. I took this year off because I didn't (and still don't) have any idea what I want to pursue as a career. I've worked the usual min. wage jobs since I was 15 and right now all I've been doing is trying to save my cash so I can get away from here one way or another.

This all started out for me in 2018. I made a friend online from Budapest who I've talked to every day since we met. After a year of us talking (and saving as much cash as I possibly could), I went out to visit her. I spent about four weeks there, just staying at her flat and doing whatever we felt like. It was wonderful, just something about being away from all this shit in the United States felt truly freeing. I love everything, the social aspects, the beauty and architecture, the friends I made while I was there, the public transport, just everything. I know no place is perfect, but I really feel like I found a place that felt right to be in, and not in some ""I went to the Bahamas and I never wanted to go back home 😩😩"" type of way. I like the changes, I like new places and I promise I'm not just putting this place on a pedistal as if it were the greatest place on the planet.

My friend told me that if I could figure out a way to get back out there and support myself that I could just stay with her at her flat for really as long as I wanted. I trust her very much and I really want to take this opportunity while I'm still young enough to make these great changes in my life.

I guess I have to put it out there that I'm not trying to go there because we're in love and want to be in a romantic relationship, I trust her and I don't think there'd ever be a case where we ""broke up"" or got into some fight that would result in me being left alone and stuck on the streets of Budapest. She's really important to me and I love her to death, she feels the same.

My main concerns that I'm trying to figure out are:
-Language
-visas
-work

<Language>
As anyone familiar with Hungary will know, Hungarian is a horribly difficult language. I've tried learning through duolingo, as well as reading a few books on the basics, but I haven't gained much knowledge yet. Lately I've been trying to do it on the daily and it's starting to click a little bit more. 

<Visa +Job>
In general I've got no idea where to start with visas. I know maybe I could get a work visa if I went there to teach English. I have had very high marks in english classes in high school and that first year of college. I considered getting a CELTA certification, but I'm not sure if that alone would be enough to land me a job. Any help finding jobs or ways to get a visa would be wonderfully appreciated. 

I know this might seem like a stretch, only those that have known me for awhile actually take me seriously on the subject because they know I really would be willing to do this. I know nobody will have all the answers, but I'd really love for people to put in their opinions and help me out if possible. If there's anything I seem to have missed or any questions you have don't hesitate to ask, I promise I will respond :>

Thanks sm in advance ♡♡♡"

My husband and I have always dreamed about moving abroad, preferably to Ireland, so we wanted to post on here to hopefully get some questions answered.

My husband (34M & Eastern European EU Citizen) works a stable Blue Collar job in the states, but it will most likely not pay well abroad. We will need to make plans to find him a job abroad. What jobs (besides tech) are high in demand in Ireland that he could potentially study or prepare himself to be competitive in, before we go abroad? Trades (if possible) would be preferable, as he does not want to return to school at the age of 34, but will if he absolutely has to.

I (27F) work in a help desk IT position while studying Computer Science, and would like to eventually obtain an internship or land my first software engineer job in Ireland, preferably in Galway. Is the tech scene also prominent outside of Dublin? Dublin rent prices seem ridiculous and Galway seems beautiful. 

How much in savings would you recommend?

Also, can we both live and work immediately in Ireland due to his EU citizenship? 

Has anyone ever made this move? In tips/advice? We have never lived outside of the US before, so we are excited, but definitely a bit nervous, which I think is natural. If you made this move, are you happy? 

Thanks so much in advance!"

I have been invited to a Master’s program in germany, I’m selling all my shit in the US and cleaning up my loose ends.

However, a few things are concerning at the moment, namely, the looming possibility of travel restrictions. For starters, Germany has closed some of their land borders already due SARS-COVID-19. I am not personally scared of the virus, as a healthy young man, I’m scared of the governments shutting me out, or quarantining me, or some other such thing.

So here are the possibilities:

1. Nothing happens, and I waltz into the country and all is fine and dandy.

2. Germany shuts down air travel, and probably land travel as well.

3. The US shuts down all flights going out (can they even do this?)

Now, I’m about to call the university and ask all of this, which is why I’m writing this post at this ungodly hour. However, I would like to know from this community as well. You all have already helped me immensely to begin this journey, and now I need help to cross the finish line successfully.

Some other pressing matters:

I can leave earlier if I need to. As early as one week from now. If that happens, I guess I’ll be staying in a hostel. I had initially planned on leaving april 1st but I’m afraid that the borders will close sooner rather than later. I’d like to avoid this if possible though, as it would probably be financially straining.

Other details: 

I recently flew to another country which has few cases of the virus. It is however, not as severe as the US itself is. Its not a country with any travel warnings as far as I know (I’d like to avoid mentioning it if I can).

I speak german, maybe A2/B1 level. Its not great but it is what it is, and I’m working on it every day.

I haven’t exactly arranged an apartment yet, but I’m working on it. I’ll need to travel with cash in hand, get my residence permit, and get an apartment, and then get a bank account.

I may be able to stay with a friend for a week or two before my apartments move in date. I have connections in Bonn, Stuttgart, and Hamburg. I may also have connections in Munich."

Hello all I (23F) am seriously considering moving abroad with my husband (28M) to the UK from USA. He is a UK citizen and it would be fairly easy for us to move there. Everything about moving to England seems amazing. I love it as a country, I love the history, the scenery, the weather, the people, and how close it is to the rest of Europe. All of my husbands family lives there as well. I, on the other hand, have no friends, and only have my mom, dad and one sibling. The relationship between the 4 of us is ok, but it is very volatile and often times toxic to be honest. In short, all that keeps me here is my family. I've broached the subject to them and they are very supportive and excited to have a place to stay abroad so I'm glad they're seeing the positives. I still feel extremely guilty and I would appreciate advise on how you all got over or coped with the pain of leaving your parents behind. I'm hispanic so family is EVERYTHING in my culture and just the thought of it makes my stomach drop from the guilt. I'll have to find a way to deal with that. I have lots of questions which I've posted in the summary. The biggest thing weighing on me is the housing market / prices. I live in a town where you can buy a 4 bedroom, single family home with land and a pool for $145k so the prices of the UK are a little daunting for me. I need a home with a yard as I would be taking two 45 pound dogs with me but all the homes are duplex style. I just get so friggin scared about doing this, but I truly feel like it would be such a good thing for us and I don't want fear, or guilt to keep me from living my life. Any tips? experiences? Advice?

TL/DR (sorta) 23F wanting to move with 28M husband to UK from USA.

1.What are some things you would have liked to know before moving over?

2. Was it difficult to get a job?

3. Do you find it easier to travel?

4.Do you have a better work life balance?

5. What are some of the nicer and quieter parts of England?

6. How is the job market for someone that has a bachelors in psych, masters in I/O psych and certificate in Business Admin?

7. Is it very difficult to find an affordable home?

8. Any tips or experiences? / What was your personal experience?

9. Where do you work?

10. Do you find that you work to live or live to work?

11. Has anyone transported their dogs over? If so how did it work?

12. IMPORTANT: Latino/a 's moving to the UK, how did you cope with the culture shock of being hispanic/ Mexican in the UK? and having to leave your family? Or is it just me being overly attached to my family? :(

I want to know as much as I can about it and personal experiences, sorry for the all the questions! Feel free to detail your experiences as MUCH as you want :D Thank you!"

We have two small children (under 5) and are starting to think a lot more about their future. I’d like them to grow up in a world where healthcare is treated as a right, and where they’re given the best possible chance to succeed. I’d also like for them to have a far-less insular view of the world and all of the different cultures in it, and I believe that living somewhere else (likely the EU?) would provide that opportunity for them.

I recognize that no place is perfect. But I want more for my family. I’ve traveled to a bunch of Western Europe, Ireland, Costa Rica, and the UK. Loved every place.

I don’t want to get into a discussion of politics, but if it helps I’d say that my worldview is fairly left of center. Everyone’s opinions are totally valid, this is just what I believe.

Some thoughts:

* I work in a profession that is fairly in-demand. Many tech companies are hiring for the work that I do, so I’m not overly concerned about finding work. Hell, I could probably continue to work for my current company remotely, but I assume it’d look better for naturalization purposes to work for a company based where we live. Having a decent tech industry would be a plus.
* Unfortunately English is our only language. Absolutely willing to learn another, and definitely want that opportunity for our kids.
* Being able to ensure our kids can enroll in school is an absolute necessity. It doesn’t have to be a fancy school by any means, but it should be resourced for a language learner.
* We have a good amount of savings. Not astronomical amounts by any measure. But from what I’ve seen I don’t think we’d fail any kind of ‘preexisting funds’ question for residency.
* We’d be moving from an area where the cost of living is very high. I’d prefer to move someplace where that isn’t the case, so we aren’t living paycheck-to-paycheck. As an example, we’ve thought of Toronto, but the housing market there seems way worse than here, so that'd be a hard sell.
* We’re very family-oriented. Wherever we move should be a great place to raise a family: parks, museums, a good community to be a part of.
* we lived in the city for 10ish years, currently in the burbs. We love it in a city, but we aren’t opposed to living just outside of one. Funny enough, we love the country too, but my spouse is very social so I think she’d lose her mind if we were too remote. It would be nice to have a tiny bit of land to work, but not a requirement.
* definitely doesn’t have to be a major city either, but being able to take a train to one every once in awhile would be nice.
* ideally it shouldn’t be horribly expensive to fly to the US. Our parents are getting older and it would be great for them to be able to visit or vice versa. They’re based on the east coast of the US. I think that takes most of Australia, Africa, and Asia out of the question.
* Bonus: We love to ski. If it isn’t a drive to skiing, we’d love to be able to get to it easily via short flight. But definitely not a requirement.

Would love to hear about:

* places that could clearly fit the bill
* countries where gaining residency isn’t a nightmare
* 2nd or 3rd tier cities in any of these countries (eg probably not Paris but Lyon? Not Amsterdam but Delft? Not London but Manchester?)

Any thoughts are appreciated! With all due respect argumentative political comments will be ignored. Thanks. :)"

So, I guess what I’m asking is would architectural offices be willing to employ an English-speaking architect who’s willing to adapt and learn the language quickly?

A close friend of mine was working in Berlin in an office with a lot of English-speaking architects. She said that that’s quite normal in Berlin, so I was wondering is there a chance for something similar in French-speaking countries of European Union?

I'd like this to be a long term move. I am studying German currently and speak English and Japanese. I have faith that by the end of the year I will be able to speak a reasonable degree of German, enough for daily life.

I am about to graduate undergrad with a non-medical degree but a plethora of STEM credits. I was originally interested in going to Nursing school in the United States and becoming an NP but have recently become interested in going to Med school in Germany (it would have to be an English program) because even though I don't have a necessary STEM degree my CV is strong enough that I feel somewhat confident that I could be accepted. 

It seems that NPs are not as common a profession in Germany and Austria as they are in the States, otherwise I would happily continue the nursing track, because patient care is #1 for me. However, if that's not a viable career choice I will happily become an MD. 

What should I know about moving to one of these two countries? What is Med school like, how selective really is it, and what should I know before going in? What is life like for expats in Aus/Ger, how easy is it to make friends, and what level of German should I be at before I go?"

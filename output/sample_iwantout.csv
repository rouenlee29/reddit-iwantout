So I currently live in Zimbabwe, but fear there aren't many opportunities here for growth, and a stable job. So I was wondering how I can somehow move to South America and get a job there.

To give you some context, I have a Masters degree in Quantitative Risk Management from the University of Cape Town, in South Africa. I work well with the programming languages Python, R,  MATLAB and Stata, and have about 1.5 years experience in the business analyst/financial analyst role.

I am open to moving to any country in South America but would prefer Brazil/Argentina.

Any help would be welcome."

I'm run an agriculture IOT startup I'm funding with the $1.5M I got from a previous startup (where I was an early employee).  It more than qualifies for the capital requirements for DAFT or the Irish startup program ([https://workpermit.com/immigration/ireland/irish-visa-start-entrepreneur-programme](https://workpermit.com/immigration/ireland/irish-visa-start-entrepreneur-programme)). 

I don't have a degree, but I am a high earner (300k-500k/year).

If I get temporary residency through the entrepreneur programs can I reasonably expect permanent residency after 5 years?  Will not having a degree hinder me?

Should I just delete this thread and wait for the responses from the actual immigration attorneys I have messaged?  Has anyone else done this kind of move?

We have lived in Belgium for 15 years now and have talked from day one about moving to the UK.

My husband has a severe form of epilepsy and is unable to work, and I am his carer. He receives a disability allowance that covers our expenses, some of which is provided since I am his carer.

I have read varying things about whether he can still claim his Belgian disability benefits while living in the UK. It is the main thing stopping us as we have no other means of income as I am unable to work due to his condition. 

We are getting older now and I find it very lonely and difficult being in Belgium, quite honestly I feel trapped there. When he is ill he is ‘not there’ and I am alone looking after him for days, weeks to sometimes months depending on the severity of his health. When we are back in the UK I have the support of my family and it’s such a relief to me to know they can pop over to see how we are doing. In Belgium we are alone. 

I have tried to look for what possibilities there would be for us but it’s such a difficult situation with his health, inability to work, my inability to work. We are desperate to make this move but we only can if he still receives his disability allowance when we are in the UK.

Is it possible? Or are we just fooling ourselves?"

Looking for some advice here. I’m a 23 year old soon to be college graduate in May. I’m finishing a B.S. in Hospitality and Tourism. 

I’m looking to improve my Spanish by immersing myself into Latin culture in South America. Since the pandemic I’ve been let go from my Hotel management job and I’ve been working on a horse farm here in central Kentucky. I am making decent money at the moment. The lease is up on my apartment in July and I’m thinking of moving back in with my Dad while I save up money for moving to South America.

I would like to live down there for a couple years. Hopefully even a different country every 6-9 months or so. I want to explore as much as possible. I’m okay with doing dirty work and will happily do odd jobs to help get by. How should I look for employment? What about visa requirements for a US citizen wanting to spend multiple years abroad? How much should I have saved up before I go?

Hopefully this isn’t too vague! I just have a desire to explore the world!! Thanks for listening. Best wishes."
g7y90x,[IWantOut] 30F Bartender USA -> Europe,1587867081.0,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/g7y90x/iwantout_30f_bartender_usa_europe/,"I want to try living somewhere new and experiencing a different culture outside the US. Over time Im feeling more and more like the US is not the right place for me. 

Citizenship/residency wont be an issue. I'm applying for Croatian citizenship through lineage. If all works out, I'll be a proud EU citizen. 

I speak English and Spanish fluently, and am learning French (but I have a long way to go). I bartend for a living and love it, though I know it doesnt pay as well in Europe. The rest of my work experience is in retail and administrative work. I have a BA in International Affairs/Studies. Other than bartending, none of them paid well and my skills arent that diverse because my city doesnt offer much opportunities for work. 
I'd prefer to keeping bartending, or have work where I get to move around, because I hate sitting at a desk all day. But hey, I'll take what will pay the bills in the end.

However, I'm wondering if the move would be worth what I'd be giving up here. I know Europe is a lot more laid back and has better working conditions, so maybe I wont burn out as easily.

Before the virus, I was objectively doing decently. I only had to work 3 days a week to make enough to cover all my living expenses with a little extra to have fun. I'll pick free time over an extravagant lifestyle anytime, because I get exhausted easily and need a lot of time to rest. (Health stuff) 

Other than all that, I'd prefer living somewhere relatively coastal, with plenty to do and where people are hopefully more friendly and down to earth. Also I have two cats I need to be able to bring with me. 

How feasible would such a move be? Would it be worth it? What do you think would be a good place for me to start over and be able to be financially secure? What are my employment options?

Thank you for any input!"

So [this](https://www.sovereignman.com/lifestyle-design/four-valuable-passports-that-anyone-can-obtain-6109/#spain) site says all it takes for me, as a Latin American, to get Spanish citizenship is to prove to the embassy that I've got 25k Euros in my bank account, then go and live there for two years on a non-lucrative resident visa..

This actually sounds doable, which makes me kinda skeptical given how impossible migrating has felt for years.


This info sounds kinda unnecessary but I'll add it just in case: I've got a US BA in International Affairs from a very well regarded school in the subject and 3 (almost 4) years of experience spanning the private, public, and non-profit sectors both in the US and in Costa Rica. I'm fluent in English, and friends that live in Spain tell me that makes it very easy to find a job there because apparently most of the population doesn't speak it very well."

I'm looking for some general advice and experiences of others! I'm a 21 year old male from New Zealand who has spent the last 3 years since finishing school working as a Sales Consultant for a Service Provider and have also worked my way into a leadership role to what is essentially a 3IC. I also had 3 years customer service experience prior to this. In 2019 I did a two month solo trip to the UK and mainland Europe and it solidified my desire to do this.  


I am currently in the process of getting registered on the Irish FBR (Foreign births register) through my ancestry which will allow me to get an Irish Passport which makes living and working in Ireland (and the rest of Europe) relatively easy. I am also under the understanding that post-brexit the CTA between Ireland and the UK will remain which allows me to live and work in the UK as well(?).

Ideally I'm wanting to find a job related to my experience but am open to new experiences but I do also want to travel during this time (at least initially)so something low hour wise/not to restrictive would be ideal. I am also interested in the potential to study somewhere, so suggestions on study locations and information like that would also be helpful. In terms of money, by December/Jan the time that I want to leave by (Covid-19 dependent) I should have at least $40,000NZD saved, so my budget is relatively open

I am interested in moving to the following places: Dublin, London, Brighton, Manchester and am also open to any other suggestions people have as well as any advice or knowledge about the places listed that it would be good to be aware of. I do also worry about the difficulty of making new friends (for example, outside of coworkers/flatmates) so if anyone has advice on forums/apps or just in general advice on how to go about this in big places that would be awesome.

I was really just hoping for some general guidance around a move like this from someone who has done it and for any additional information people can give me.

My interests are in contemporary nomadism, post-Soviet development and internationalization, processes of ethnic assimilation and preservation (particularly in the relationships, historical and present, between Turkic and Iranic populations in Central Asia, although more recently Russification is a big one), and frontier studies, particularly in relation to migration patterns in the wake of both the Soviet collapse and regional warfare. Since these are obviously some diverse interests (and I have others), I expect to narrow down my focus as I continue my studies over the next few years.

Currently I'm only in my first year of community college, but I plan to transfer to the University of Oregon within a year, where I'll major in anthropology. I have yet to decide whether I'm more interested in cultural anth or archaeology, but they don't offer an archaeology degree as such—I'd have to move east for that. Though I'm studying Persian on my own time right now, I'll also study it formally for the first time there. I also plan to study Russian and probably a Turkic language, maybe Uzbek.

My grades are excellent so far and I'm very interested in maintaining them so as to qualify for as many merit scholarships and grants as I may be eligible for. I'm from a financially disadvantaged background, yet for the time being cannot receive federal financial aid due to circumstances outside of my control, so that's been and will continue to be a major obstacle in realizing my ambitions.

Ideally, I'd like to explore opportunities for research in this region as soon as possible following my BA. I expect my MA to take me out of state at the least and quite possibly out of the US, and for the moment it's impossible to tell where I'll end up. Is it likely that I'll be able to begin fieldwork in this region before undertaking my MA?

My intent is definitely not to move to this region permanently. I'm interested in what steps I should be taking, short-term and long-term, in being able to work in this region within the next few years, and to establish a place for myself in the scholarship around it. What general advice would you give to other would-be scholars in my position? Any particular advice for my case?

Thanks."

I got my Bachelor’s in Chemistry here in the USA and have been working as a chemist since I graduated at 22. I am currently a chemistry lab supervisor. My plan is to apply to German Master’s of Chemical Engineering programs that are taught at least partly in English. I took German language courses when I lived over there, and when I returned to America, so I am Intermediate Level German speaker (not sure of the conversion to A Levels). My internship was through the DAAD RISE program, and I continued to work for the DAAD as an ambassador when I returned to America, so I think my chances of being accepted to a Master’s Program are okay given my history with the country’s academic programs and language. Looking for opinions here as to what my chances of acceptance might be.

My main question is -if I were to get my Master’s of Chemical Engineering in Germany, would I be able to return to America to and work as an engineer? I’ve generally thought that EU and USA had good exchange of accepting degrees except for professional schools like Law and Medicine. Has anyone returned or emigrated to the USA with a German engineering degree that can offer advice?

I actually might have multiple ancestry paths via my father, but based on the documentation I have on hand so far, the line I am planning to use right now is the following:

Great grandfather - born 1878 in Augusta Sicily
Great grandmother - born 1889 in August Sicily

They were married 1911 in Augusta Sicily.  They came to the states shortly after. 

Grandmother was born 1923. 

Great grandfather is naturalized in 1925. 

Father is born in 1952. 

So, based on the concept of citizenship passing through blood (along with the other rules in place), my grandmother was passed Italian citizenship from my great grandfather because he was not yet a US citizen when she was born; because my father was born after 1948, that means he was passed the right to Italian citizenship from Grandma and then so on and so forth. 

So a few questions:

- Am I correct and the interpretation of the rules and how it applies to my case?
- I’ve already been in contact with Augusta’s Registrar of Vital Statistics to obtain the long form birth certificate; is the marriage registration important as well?
- I know this process will take a while (I won’t go to the consulate to apply until Nov of next year), but what are the subsequent steps (if it all works out of course) to getting my wife and child citizenship as well?

It would also be great to hear any success stories from anyone with a similar family history."

g7vpxv,[IWantOut] 33F Accountant/AML Analyst USA -> UK,1587858750.0,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/g7vpxv/iwantout_33f_accountantaml_analyst_usa_uk/,"Quick background rundown: 

* I am a US citizen with a current passport (renewed this year due to name change).
* I have a bachelor’s in Accounting (May 2019), and an associate’s in Medical Administration with a      Concentration in Medical Transcription (December 2010). 
* I have worked in retail for a little over five years, about four years as a medical transcriptionist/patient registration, four months in data entry, and I am currently working as an AML analyst for a multinational bank as of February 2020. 

I am looking for any available avenue to get to the UK, and I will admit there is a bit of desperation that is creeping through. My fiancé is a British citizen, but due to being a type 1 diabetic and ongoing medical issues, he is unable to work and is barely scraping by with Universal Credit. 

Here is where the desperation is coming in: he has double retinal bleeds, and he is slowly going blind. He has already had two operations on his right eye to correct it, and it started clouding over again while there is blood in the left eye that hinders his vision. 

I have tried looking into several avenues to try and get over to England, which includes: 

**Tier 4 Student Visa**: As stated above, I have my bachelor's, so I was considering going over to obtain a master’s in accounting. However, I do not have the funds for the living expense required to obtain a Tier 4 student visa (£1,105/month when living outside of London, from my research). I would be able to stay at my fiancé’s during that time, but I doubt they would take that into consideration.

**Fiance Visa**: This was another option I had looked into, but our problem is that 1) he cannot work, so he does not meet the minimum salaried requirements, and 2) neither of us have enough in the bank to meet the financial requirements (£16,000, last I checked). I am slowly storing away money, but it would take a few years to get that much, which includes compensating for the exchange rate.

**Work Visa**: I was looking at jobs in the UK, but as a recent graduate with zero job or internship experience, it might be a hard sell to get a company to sponsor me. At that time, I had a dwindling savings account with no means to relocate. Right now, my savings are growing, and I already have a ticket to England for October (originally meant to visit my fiancé until I can move there on a more permanent basis). 

**Current Employment**: Right now, my best shot of making it over to England, in my eyes, is through my current employer. However, I have only been with the company for three months, and they require you to stay in your current position for a year. An exception may be possible if I could make a vertical movement within the company, but I believe they would only do that for someone with more seniority (and skill). 

I could make a plea, with my manager, to relocate to England for six months to help my fiancé, which is only possible due to a majority of our workforce working from home for the foreseeable future. I doubt it will go anywhere, but I am going to speak to him, off the record, about the possibility and what hoops I would need to jump through if it is. 

I have read where people have entered the country and started job hunting that way. Still, I want to remain as legitimate in my immigration as possible to avoid any kind of fallout (such as preventing me from marrying my fiancé). I have looked through everything I could think of, and I am trying to think logically about my situation. 

There was some consideration about bringing my fiancé over to the US, but I’m terrified our whole healthcare system (mostly insurance) would kill him. Despite working for a multinational bank, the health insurance I have isn’t that great, and what would I do if I lost my job when he got here?  

I am trying to familiarize myself with UK KYC/AML and have been attempting to become more acquainted with Excel formulas. However, while my current job uses Excel, they are big fans of pivot tables and not much else. I am also working on a CV and will attempt to apply to companies in the UK. 

I may be S.O.L. right now, but I would not be able to forgive myself if I didn’t try exhausting every possibility. Thank you for any and all advice."

I love to travel. I've visited 13 countries, but now I want to experience living in some of them. As a software engineer I see much better opportunities to grow and find my place in this world in one of my target countries (at least for now).

I'm single. I speak English, Russian, Kazakh and some French (like B1 or so).


**Destinations**:

So the countries where I would like to end up are (in order of decreasing priority):
- UK, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Canada (ON, QC, BC);
- Germany, USA (CA, NY, MA), the Netherlands, Denmark, Austria;
- Belgium, Luxembourg, Czech Republic, Poland;


**Experience**:

I've worked in several different industries and with different technologies: ~1 year in a bank developing internal corporate web services (both frontend and backend), ~1 year in an IT company as a intelligent automation engineer (designing and implementing data processing pipelines) working with RPA (using Selenium), Java and Groovy, ~1 year in the same company as a machine learning engineer implementing document classification and information extraction systems, and the last ~5 months still in the same company as a backend web developer doing regular backend stuff.


I'm passionate about programming, math and data. I'm willing to grow in data science and machine learning, but I'm still okay with any software engineering position. I'm eager to learn new things, I'm always enthusiastic about that. I've changed my domain and tech stack 3 times for the last 3 years and got used to new tools and technologies very quickly. So, it would be fine with any software engineering job, even those I haven't done before.


For the last ~6 months I've been trying to find a good job offer in my target countries, but I did not succeed much. And now there are worldwide lockdown and closed borders.


So for my future search and hopefully relocation, when it is all over, I'm seeking help with proper ways of searching for and applying for jobs in my target countries and any other guidance that you think can be useful!"

First of all, I chose Australia because 
1) I was supposed to study there for my undergrad (I already applied to a few universities) but my family did not let me push through with it.
2) I’ve been there a couple of times and really appreciate the lifestyle 
3) my dad knows a few people there in case of emergencies

However, I have NO direct relatives there at all. I would gladly take any other suggestion that would fit my situation better. I would have chosen the US, but it seems as though the current president is anti-immigrant. Plus, it takes 10 years to be a permanent resident. 

So, here’s my situation:
I’m a medical laboratory science student who will be graduating in 2021. Although my uni is one of the best for my degree, the average pay will still be extremely LOW in Manila (much less elsewhere). I’m talking 15,000PHP = 462AUD per month! It’s horrible. Aside from that, I find Manila to be quite suffocating with all the traffic and the annual alarming increase in population. And, it’s still getting worse. So I’m planning to start my career abroad sometime in the future. Though I am fully aware that it will not be easy.

Aside from the IELTS, all I know is that I have to pass the ASCP exam (the medtech license that is recognized internationally) and have 2 years of working experience. But when I do, what’s next? 

1. Do I apply for a student visa/ working visa/ other? 
2. Do I find work there first or do I have to take a few additional classes and enroll in a school?
3. How hard will it be as a non-Australian to find work? 
4. For MedTechs abroad, are you able to support yourself alone?
5. Is Australia a good country overall? Or should I plan to move elsewhere?

Thank you!

[EDIT]

I’ve read the recent news about Australian government telling immigrants to ‘go home’ so I’m kind of iffy about it at the time moment. But we’ll see in a few years. Hopefully I can get other suggestions anywhere else! Studying is an option as well for me but according to what I’ve seen, some unis don’t accept international students to study their Masters program. Perhaps they’re more lenient in European countries? Appreciate if you let me know! :)"

Have recently received my EU passport as I proven linkage to my grandfather who emigrated here from Hungary (EU passport). As much as i love Hungary (and have visited several times) I would like to use this opportunity to take advantage of the affordable / free education in Europe.

In an ideal world I am looking to start my interest in computer / IT (computer interests that I am looking to finally pursue -- like the idea of pursuing as its a very lucrative career path that can transition into European workforce)

Each of these countries always pop up in internet discussions as the ""top"" country study/live which shows in infrastructure, job opportunities, diversity, expat friendliness (France interests me because I am currently studying French and have been exposed to French my entire Canadian life)

I have been to all of these countries as a tourist in the past however I am reaching out for feedback/experiences on people who have LIVED or STUDIED and can share their experiences in the beginning. How did you decide on your city/university/career/program ? Did you find it worth it? Discovery any job opportunities to English speakers post-study ?  Make any connections/networks ?

There is obviously way more to the surface of ""leaving to Europe to start a new path"" (taxes, social life, loopholes of living, DIFFICULTY of the university) and that is why I appreciate any feedback to helping start my goal.

To cut the story short, I am a Brazilian and I would like to try life in the USA southern states (California, Florida?). Climate is similar to Brazil.

Plan number 1) I have an opportunity to go study in Canada for my undergrad degree (study permit is already in hands). But I have already spent some months in Canada and the winter has really tired me, to the point it was affecting both my physical and mental health. I do not know if I can live there for my entire life. USA southern states have a climate that is more similar to that of Brazil. So in this situation I would study in Canada, graduate and somehow.. go to the USA? Still not sure how that would work out. I assume having a Canadian degree would make it easier to get a job there, but certainly I will not stay in Canada until I get a citizenship. I will not spend the best part of my youth where I do not want to be. So I would be a Brazilian (maybe Canadian permanent resident, maybe temporary resident), hoping that a company will sponsor a work visa in the US. Crazy plan, I know.

Plan number 2) I can go to university in Brazil. After I graduate, hope that a company will sponsor a work visa in the US. Much simpler plan, but just as risky depending on how you see things.

Pros and cons of each plan in my perspective:

Plan 1) I believe a canadian undergrad degree is much more recognized anywhere in the world than a Brazilian one. Once I graduate, salary in Canadian dollar, worth nearly 3 Brazilian reais, so I could hope to be able to pay a Master's in the US after some 3 years working full time in Canada. On the con side, this would mean living about 8 years in a place that makes me unhappy. My parents would be paying international tuition for me in my undergrad years, which is insanely expensive. I am greatly concerned that such big downsides outweigh the advantages.

Plan 2) smoother path of life, one could say? In Brazil, I will enjoy more my college years, will be near my family and friends. On the cons side, I know many Brazilians who would kill to get a work visa in the US. I would be in the same situation as they are. I am not sure if having a Canadian degree would make it significantly easier, but it is extremely hard as a Brazilian to make this move. Also, really unlikely that I will ever have the money to afford a master's in the US.

So, since this is a move that I am planning several years in advance, I would like your opinions on these matters. Do you think I am mistaken in my pro/con analysis for both plans? Am I missing or misjudging something? Does plan 1 sound too crazy? Thanks for the help"

She is currently on a student visa (TIE) in Spain that expires June 30, 2020. She is planning on doing her masters in Germany next year. She will most likely be accepted into the program as she fulfills all the requirements and has really good grades, however the  actual acceptance letter won’t come until the end of June or mid July. 
Her original plan was to go back to the US for one or two months after her TIE expires, then come to Germany on her 90 day visa waiver, find a place to stay in the university city and then apply for a residence card. 
With the current situation, everything looks very different. Returning to the US is not really an option. The area where she is from is hit really bad by corona and it’s not looking to get better any time soon. The EU is already talking about leaving the borders to non- EU states closed until the end of September. We are worried that this could be extended even further and she wouldn’t be allowed to enter on time for university to begin. 
As soon as she is allowed to travel within Schengen, she can come stay with me. But since this massively changes the time line there are questions regarding her visa(s):

1. girlfriend has to apply to residence permit within those 90 days visa waiver. Does that have to be in the beginning so it’s processed while she’s still on her waiver or can she apply towards the end of the 90 days?

2. in order to apply to the residence permit she must be registered by the city she lives in. She needs an apartment in order to get registered. Could she register in my home town that is not near the university city (different state even) for the time being and then register in the university city later?

4. does she need to apply for a residence permit at the Ausländerbehörde in her university city or can she apply in my home town/state and then „transfer“?

5. as soon as the Spanish TIE expires she can stay in Schengen for 90 more days. If she leaves Spain and comes to Germany before the TIE expires, do the 90 days start then or only after the TIE expires?"

I currently have a job at the hospital as a cleaner and it’s very good pay but sadly my contract ends after the pandemic. 

I’m scared because I literally am working from the bottom in terms of getting to France. From homeless to living there, I’m so scared of failing."

This is also very dependent on the COVID situation in the fall... 

Anyways, I have some logistical questions that I don't know if people will know the answers to. I don't need a student visa because of my dual citizenship, although I am confused about how this works - for example, would I just leave the US with my US passport and then go through the EU passport check when I enter the country? And if I just do that, can I just stay there or do I need to notify the US or something? In general, is there anything I know about moving to the Netherlands/abroad (besides taxes, health insurance, and bank accounts, which I am slowly figuring out)? This is my first time moving by myself, so I'm sorry if these things are obvious to some.

Also, I have no intention on staying in the Netherlands (unless I somehow learn to love the grey weather and as far as I can tell from other expats, less tolerant culture; don't get me wrong, I'm excited to live there for 3 years, but probably no longer). I will be majoring in CS, so I was wondering if anyone knows how easy it is for someone with a CS degree to get a job outside of the country they got that degree in. I'm pretty sure that it is one of the easier degrees to transfer countries with and it's probably helpful that I am female; I would prefer to move to Argentina/Chile, but even if I decide to move back to the US, is it possible to get a job in the US with a degree obtained from Holland or will they view it as lesser?"

So like the title says, I'm from the US, with only US citizenship. However I am currently living in Iceland as part of an exchange program. (I began grad school in 2018 in Sweden.) I am studying computer science and doing my thesis in robotics. I was only out of college for like a year before I went to grad school, so I have only about a year of professional experience. I did work in computing as a student, however, and have experience in high performance computing and general IT. I have undergrad degrees in computer engineering and French. After graduation I will have 2 master degrees in computer science because of my exchange program. I have a good grasp on French, however I think it would be maybe 6 months before I could actively participate in a technical work discussion or the like, since I am rusty. I had a Swedish residence permit and currently have an Icelandic residence permit (not sure if that's relevant).


**Destinations:**


I would like to live and work in the EU after graduation in June. Specifically, the countries where I would like to end up are (in order of decreasing priority): Spain, Denmark, Netherlands, France, Belgium. I've spent some small amounts of time (a few weeks) in each of these countries and would like to try living in one of them. I would prefer not to return to the US or Sweden.


**Concerns:**


I have been looking for jobs in robotics in these countries and they certainly exist, but I am wondering what my chances of getting a work permit are. I understand that a company will have to sponsor me, and I am concerned that my small level of professional experience will be a prohibitively difficult block in this case. I don't really want to stay in Iceland, even as beautiful as it is, but I understand that as someone who has completed my studies in Iceland, I will have the option to extend my residence permit for 6 months in order to seek work. This should allow me to also have Schengen travel freedom, just not Schengen work freedom. This means that I could get some temporary job in Iceland while still looking for a job in my preferred EU countries, which takes away a bit of the stress.


What are my chances of ending up with a job in Spain or Denmark?"

I also fell in love with West Europe on my trip last year. I have a 3-year automotive technology diploma from a German-Malaysian collaborative vocational school here in Malaysia, currently in a local university doing my 4-year BSc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I speak English at a C1 level/7-8 IELTS and currently studying German, which I'm probably somewhere at A2 (I have not taken a test on this yet). I'll graduate in three years so that's ample time to ramp up my German, I think! 

I have a good friend who can host me in Munchen for my master's, so I am wondering how tough is it to get into TUM or Munich uni of applied sciences for a master's program in ECE/related? What can I do to help with my application? I asked another friend in Karlsruhe and he says everyone wants to go to Munich so admission can be tough? I'm also a little insecure regarding the fact that my qualifications come from a developing country but I've been told that shouldn't be a problem.

I know there are other engineering schools in cities like Aachen and Darmstadt but not having to survive alone and saving thousands on housing cost are really the first things I'm considering here. 

Also, is there any document that my friend, who's older and owns a successful business, can give me that allows me to present a smaller amount for the 10k proof of fund for the visa application?

g6nu37,[IWantOut] 28M Anthropologist/Counselor Norway -> Europe/North America/Oceania,1587681644.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/g6nu37/iwantout_28m_anthropologistcounselor_norway/,"I am a 28 year old Norwegian holding a master's in Anthropology, and one academic year in Project Management (vocational education). I also have six years of work experience from customer service, and have undertaken several engagements in the nonprofit sector parallel to my previous studies.

Currently, I just finished up the first of a two-year retraining study in Counselling/Coaching. My career aspiration is to help people finding a sense of achievement and succeed in life. I've also been lucky being accepted as a trainee at a local branch of the Clubhouse Foundation (a great institution by the way). However, future wise, I don't wish to narrow down my scope to any given sectors/branches, as long as I'm able to work in a position that include counseling and preferably cultural-related areas too.

So, the thing is that because of my domestic work market's competitiveness and limited opportunities for applicants with my background, I had to take an irrelevant job at a customer service. I've been in the job for over three years now, but started to apply for relevant (anthropology) jobs already after I graduated. Now, four years and a ton of denials later, I've never felt more hopeless in terms of finding a desired job at home. And the current pandemic isn't really making things any better quite frankly.

I realize I need to ask myself the question - how much longer am I going to accept this... Well, I guess situation or may you call it fate? It's so frustrating to go through this much resistance when I have all this motivation, competence and visions for my life. My English proficiency is really solid too relatively speaking. So, I suppose that's what recently triggered the idea of looking for work abroad instead.

I've always identified as a global-oriented guy, and as I have no ties to family or my home country, going abroad isn't a far-fetched idea. Norway is a great country in terms of employment, but the work market practices favoritism of certain educations, and offers little space for people who don't fit into the box (google the ""Jante Law"" and you'll understand). Moving abroad, there's so many questions arising - where to start, career searching, visa, housing, everyday life and so on. I am fully aware that the process of moving to a foreign country and settling down requires a lot from you, logistically and personally. But I'm pretty confident that I'll be able to make it when the right opportunities appear.

This post became longer than expected and I hope my rambling didn't cause you to fall off on the way. You see, context is part of my DNA. Anyways, I would receive all of your ideas, thoughts, advice and suggestions with great appreciation. My post may seem vague in some sort of sense, but my approach to this project is quite open-minded, and I have no problem providing any further details if needed.

Thanks in advance and wish you all a great day!"
g6snaq,[IWantOut] 27m US -> Canada,1587697406.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/g6snaq/iwantout_27m_us_canada/,"My wife and I are American, currently residing in Germany, and considering a move to Canada. We are both 27. I hold a Bachelor's degree and am working on a master's (remotely), and my wife holds a Bachelor's degree in teaching (all from American universities). I have a few years' experience in marketing and supply chain mgmt, and she has a few years of teaching experience in the US.

We're interested in the express entry program, which would allow us to gain permanent residence immediately (once approved, obviously), but we would need to improve our CRS (Comprehensive Ranking System) scores a bit before we'd be realistic candidates for an invitation to apply for express entry.

If we wait until next year to submit our CRS scores, when I finish my master's, my score should jump up high enough to get us an invitation to apply for permanent residence. Having said that, given the length of the application process, that means we likely couldn't move and enter the job market until the end of 2021, or even early 2022.

That said, we believe my wife would be qualified to transfer her still-current US teaching license to a Canadian province (ideally Alberta, but we're flexible) right now. Holding a provincially-issued professional license would increase her CRS score fairly dramatically, and make it way easier for her to find a teaching job, which would also dramatically increase her CRS score.

Unfortunately... we have been told that one cannot get a provincial teaching license without first holding a work permit. But, she can't get a work permit without a job offer, and she probably can't get a job offer without already holding the license, which she can't get without a work permit. Feels like a catch-22...

Is there some way around this we're not seeing? Does anyone have any experience with getting a job offer for a K-12 teaching position in Canada before being able to transfer your teaching credentials from your home country? Is there perhaps a better route/program that we're not aware of? Or do we just need to wait a year or two for our CRS scores to go up and apply for express entry then?

I will go ahead and acknowledge that, yes, in theory, I could try to go find a job and get a temporary work permit, which might grant her an open work permit, but my undergraduate degree is in a totally different field than my work experience, and I'm not really confident that the government would sign off on any job offers to me right this second, especially given the current rise in unemployment going on. That will change after I finish my master's, and sit for a few associated certification exams, but again, that won't be for another year.

Anyway, the answer may just be that we need to settle in and wait for now, but I definitely appreciate any advice."

I am a 26 female currently residing in southeastern part of the states with my husband. I work in real estate and husband works for a global Fintech company in corporate strategy. We are young professionals with no children trying to find our place in the world. We love to travel and have been visiting different countries in Europe routinely for the last 4 years. I have fallen in love with the lifestyle and attitudes over there. It seems that on a whole, people in Europe and specifically the counties I’ve traveled to, value work life balance. The cities are beautiful, transportation is much more convenient, you have the ability to travel freely, cheaply and quickly throughout the European Union, healthcare system is very reasonable, and college tuition is subsidized. What else am i missing lol?! 

My husband is a bit of a capitalist who came from a poor, rural area in the south. He works incredibly hard and is climbing the corporate ladder to afford us the lifestyle he wants. I’m much more laid back. I don’t need much if I’m geographically located somewhere I love. He doesn’t feel moving to really anywhere in Europe is worth it (I.e major salary reduction and increase in living costs). He enjoys visiting there but truly believes USA is the best place to live. While I don’t deny that USA is a wonderful place to come from and full of opportunity (I know I am very lucky to be a citizen here and love my country), I can’t help but think it’s not the place for me personally. I am very liberal, very open to ideas like universal healthcare and even UBI. I feel like I clash severely with all my friends and family. I disagree with everything Trump and his administration stands for on a fundamental level. My home state is beginning to not feel like my home at all. I suppose We could move further north to places like NYC and I might find myself around more like minded individuals... but our country is still so incredibly divided right now. 

My question- am I crazy/naive for wanting to leave the states and move to somewhere in Europe? I would like to hear from people who actually live somewhere in Europe, especially the UK, and what their thoughts are. I’m not wanting to really dig into the logistics of the how we’d get there because it’s not worth even considering until I hear the informed opinions of those who have either made the move or have experience living in these regions (my husband also may have global opportunity in Europe with his company anyway that could help with that situation). 

And for those pro US to Europe- how the hell do I convince my dear husband (who is open minded yet slightly stubborn) that this would be a great life decision? 

This is strictly a post for information and opinions only. I’m not making any moves yet, just pondering while I self isolate :)"

So I’m a student who’s realized I can’t afford my home city. I love to travel, I’ve worked abroad throughout college, and I want out. Does anyone have experience working in the legal field of a foreign country- with English as their only language? 

I’m about to graduate from my undergrad law degree (postgrad study would be needed for me to be a practicing lawyer). My grades are quite good, my average will hopefully be a 2:1 or first, but my CV isn’t amazing so Google isn’t going to offer me a fabulous relocation package. 

I’m trying to compile a list of countries or even cities where I can work exclusively in English while I learn the language. Of course I’ll learn how to speak the local language when I know where I’m going, but that will take a while. I would love to work in a job related to my field- if I leave Europe and need a visa, I suppose I’ll have to. 

So I’m asking; 

- Does anyone have experience securing an entry level job abroad through English? How did you find the position, have you any tips? 

- Any law grads working outside of the jurisdiction they studied in? (Btw- I am aware of the process of being admitted to the bar in another EU country. I’d be open to the idea in the future, but I need a more immediate plan). 

- Is there anywhere else you would recommend to me for any other reason? Good employment prospects, particularly friendly to foreigners, good standard of living? I’m very open to opinions. 

- I would be open to working in retail or admin in a new city to learn to speak the language, but only if I can be pretty damn sure it will pay off. 

As it stands I would absolutely love to work in the Netherlands, Malta or Germany but I’m held back by only knowing English. Somewhere like Australia or America would be fantastic, and I could possibly get over on a grad visa, but I don’t know if I could get an employer/sponsor from afar. I really appreciate any advice anyone can give me, either specific recommendations or methods to narrow down my shortlist."

As far as work experience, I've got about 5.5 years of software engineering experience (specifically Javascript and React) along with 6 months as a team lead. I do have a bachelor's degree, but it's in the social sciences.

My issue is basically that I was specifically looking at relocating to Montréal due to the cost of living, the cultural life (I play and release music) and the bike network/transit, but I'm just a couple points shy of a certificate of selection for the skilled worker program due to my total lack of French. I am open to another urban center like Toronto or Vancouver, since I might have a bit of a shot at being a provincial nominee, but I'd really prefer to get to Montréal. 

Do I have another option as far as Quebec goes, like being brought over on a temporary worker visa and eventually applying to stay? Another option would be acquiring some knowledge of French, but I don't know how much I could learn in a short-ish time frame. Or should I just look at another province altogether?

(I have around 8 000 usd in my apartment) Thing is, I called the bank and after heated arguments they told me that they wouldn't transfer my funds to a German bank in order to open a blocked account.

Has anyone been through something similar? I tried calling the German embassy but I believe they are closed due to the ongoing Corona crisis. I was hoping if anyone has any information on alternatives that the German government could accept."

How realistic is it that I can find a job working in the Netherlands, totally through English? I’d also love to join a graduate programme, I’m searching LinkedIn for opportunities. I’m prepared to learn Dutch or any other language, but as of right now is it feasible for me to find maybe a large international company where I can get by speaking Dutch?

I am considering moving to Europe after COVID-19 is over. One of my grandparents was a citizen of a country which is now in the EU. I am eligible for citizenship by descent but the process is difficult. Just getting the documentation together would require hiring a law firm and spending thousands of euros on top of the government's fees.

As an experienced developer wanting to work in one of the big tech hubs (likely Berlin but I'm not sure yet), getting a residence permit as a non-EU citizen would not be much of an obstacle. My understanding is that foreign workers generally have equal access to things like healthcare and temporary unemployment insurance.

Hello everyone!

I'm a 3rd year student in Scotland. I chose a biology degree with the mindset ""follow what you enjoy and you'll never work a day in your life"", but I've since realised I have no idea what I want to do when I graduate. It seems many biological jobs are highly competitive and not well-paying, I wish I'd considered this before I applied for my degree.

I've been interested in Korean culture for many years, having studied Taekwon-do to black belt. I've begun learning hangeul and soon more conversational Korean. I'm fairly certain I want to leave Scotland as I want to go somewhere completely different and experience another culture. I'd also like to experience living elsewhere as I'm beginning to resent certain aspects of life in the UK and I'd like an alternate perspective.

I have no strong preference of city in Korea, although I imagine areas close to Soeul will probably have the most foreigners and opportunities. I'm also keen to learn Korean and cultural customs, so language classes, volunteering, any social activities, and martial arts would be a great help. I'm also not certain when I'd leave, but I hope to do so within the next 3-4 years depending on work or study opportunities.

I've been looking into English teaching jobs as an entrance, though I know they're dead-end; I hope to find a more long-term career. I'm also looking into postgraduate study in South Korea to see whether this could improve my job-prospects there. While I do enjoy teaching and helping others, I'd prefer a job that's more scientific or industrial, but not necessarily biology-related. I've considered academia, it's been my plan within the UK, although I'm not sure whether this is achieveable in Korea. 

Any input, advice, or experience would be greatly appreciated :)"

I currently live in Europe and I completed my master's degree near the end of 2019. I have dual citizenship (US and EU). I was raised in Chicago for most of my life and I completed my bachelor's degree there but moved to Europe with my parents because their pension goes a long way here once exchanged. As much as I like Europe I really miss the US. I know that many members of this subreddit are US citizens looking to escape the US but I actually want to go back. Yes, healthcare, education and work-life balance is generally better across Europe compared to the US but there are some things I miss. I miss the people, way higher salaries, better entertainment, way better food, and so on. Before the pandemic hit I actually had some interviews but others have been postponed until the situation is under control. This gives me more time to think about where I would like to move to.

Now, I originally wanted to move back to Chicago but I am considering moving to other midwestern states such as Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin or Missouri. I've only been to Indiana and Missouri and I really enjoyed my stay. On top of that, cost of living seems way better compared to Illinois. My questions are: Have any US citizens applied to jobs located in the US from a different continent and actually got offers? How much did you have in savings before moving? Do you regret your decision? Also, if anyone is from these states (besides IL), would you recommend it as a place to live?

Just for more background: I have a STEM master's degree and am actively seeking career opportunities in environmental, health & safety. However, I am open to transition to another career as I apply to the career of my interest. Some programs that I I have learned during my education are R, SAS, ArcGIS, Tableau, and of course MS Office. I also have 6k saved up from my part time job while completing my studies.

Unfortunately, things didn't go as I expect(*I waited 17 months to get my residence card, a single letter didn't come and I got sick about it*) and I moved back to Turkey.

I interest in fixing things but in Turkey, I don't have any chance to get any education about being electrician or mechanic in Turkey because of my age(25y/o). And, I am considering registering for a trade school in Australia to be a mechanic. Now my Questions are,

Most of the schools offer part-time education like 2 days in week or weekend, and there is not enough information about programs(I think they are not popular).

\-If I apply one of the schools as I said will I able to have a work visa too or to have a work visa should I go to a ""full time"" school?

\-Being a mechanic in Australia worth investing at least 10-12K per year AUD.-Do you think can I keep alive myself while paying school fees, rent, basic expenses with minimum wage in Melbourne?

Facts about me 

* Worked as a legal assistant for the past few years. Looking to do something policy related, perhaps for a nonprofit or a government agency
* Would not need to take out any loans to attend
* I have American and a German passport (through descent), so visas are a non-issue for the EU and the US (yeah I know the UK isn't in the EU anymore) 

What makes this sort of unusual for me is that I'm really not that interested in (though I'm open to it if there's a good job offer) staying in the UK after graduation. I enjoyed London when I visited, but it's not my favorite place ever. I would prefer personally to return to the US or move on to continental Europe. 

I'm for the most part wondering what the experience is like for those that have gone back to their home country or moved on to another country after their education abroad. A few questions to that end 

* I understand I could attend a university in continental Europe, but my understanding is that British degrees are very well regarded in Europe and tend to be more recognized in the US, no?
* Was the networking for your education constricted to where you went to school or were there other opportunities provided?

Is MS absolutely necessary, since I already have a Master's degree? Any help is highly appreciated.

I want to move to Germany, but I'm not sure if I'm moving for the right reasons. Basically, I did my masters in the Netherlands (as a foreign student from the US; I'm a US Citizen) and am now working for a company in the Netherlands. I made a lot of friends during my masters studies, and they were all foreign students like me. It's no secret that many foreign students leave the Netherlands after their studies to seek better opportunities in other countries, which has been sad for me as a lot of my friends already left. It got to a point where my friends were leaving the Netherlands at a rate of 1 per month, which felt like I was hemmoraging social connections. Anyways, a large group of them have moved to Germany, specifically Munich, and I find myself often going there for weekend trips, since they have frequent gatherings and outings. They are living there happily and don't have any plans to move back to the Netherlands. For me, the Flixbus fares + time spent traveling really does add up.

The reservation I have about moving is that, I heard as one ages and gets into a relationship/married, they rely less on their platonic friends for socializing. Indeed, I have never heard of someone moving to a different country to follow their friends.

Sure, there are also other reasons why I would want to move to Germany. For one, salaries in Munich are much higher than in the Netherlands. Despite the higher cost of living, my friends in Munich are still able to save more money than I can. (to buy property at some point in the future) Secondly, there are more opportunities in my field in Germany than in the Netherlands. These are valid reasons as well, and I'm also not totally satisfied with my current career situation, and don't see much room to grow within the limited job market for my field in the Netherlands. (If I was purely motivated by money though, I would move back to Silicon Valley, but I'm not)

So, in short, there is nothing tying me down to where I'm currently living. I don't have many friends and feel isolated. Dutch people are pleasant, but hard to get close to. Regardless, I have a decent life here financially speaking, and have my established routine, hobbies, and habits, so is it worth making the jump? Gut says yes, but I need a sanity check.

When I first came to the Netherlands, I had all these naive expectations about living in a liberal society with progressive values, etc, and the longer I live here, I realize that my impression as an American was totally wrong. If I were to move again, I would not have so many stereotypes and expectations, and try to keep an open mind. Learning German would be fine, since I already speak somewhat decent Dutch.

Lastly, I'm not too worried about finding a job, since my field is in demand there and my friends can refer me to their companies. I also already have work authorization in Germany (EU Blue Card), so the transition shouldn't be too painful."

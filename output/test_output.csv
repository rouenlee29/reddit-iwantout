g89w9a,25m,Zimbabwe,['Africa'],[],['south america'],financial analyst/data analyst,2020-04-26,"Hi, 

So I currently live in Zimbabwe, but fear there aren't many opportunities here for growth, and a stable job. So I was wondering how I can somehow move to South America and get a job there.

To give you some context, I have a Masters degree in Quantitative Risk Management from the University of Cape Town, in South Africa. I work well with the programming languages Python, R,  MATLAB and Stata, and have about 1.5 years experience in the business analyst/financial analyst role.

I am open to moving to any country in South America but would prefer Brazil/Argentina.

Any help would be welcome."

I'm run an agriculture IOT startup I'm funding with the $1.5M I got from a previous startup (where I was an early employee).  It more than qualifies for the capital requirements for DAFT or the Irish startup program ([https://workpermit.com/immigration/ireland/irish-visa-start-entrepreneur-programme](https://workpermit.com/immigration/ireland/irish-visa-start-entrepreneur-programme)). 

I don't have a degree, but I am a high earner (300k-500k/year).

If I get temporary residency through the entrepreneur programs can I reasonably expect permanent residency after 5 years?  Will not having a degree hinder me?

Should I just delete this thread and wait for the responses from the actual immigration attorneys I have messaged?  Has anyone else done this kind of move? 

&#x200B;

Thanks!"
g88ih5,35f,Belgium,['Europe'],['United Kingdom'],['Europe'],carer,2020-04-26,"I should clarify that I am from the UK but my husband is Belgian. We have lived in Belgium for 15 years now and have talked from day one about moving to the UK.

My husband has a severe form of epilepsy and is unable to work, and I am his carer. He receives a disability allowance that covers our expenses, some of which is provided since I am his carer.

I have read varying things about whether he can still claim his Belgian disability benefits while living in the UK. It is the main thing stopping us as we have no other means of income as I am unable to work due to his condition. 

We are getting older now and I find it very lonely and difficult being in Belgium, quite honestly I feel trapped there. When he is ill he is ‘not there’ and I am alone looking after him for days, weeks to sometimes months depending on the severity of his health. When we are back in the UK I have the support of my family and it’s such a relief to me to know they can pop over to see how we are doing. In Belgium we are alone. 

I have tried to look for what possibilities there would be for us but it’s such a difficult situation with his health, inability to work, my inability to work. We are desperate to make this move but we only can if he still receives his disability allowance when we are in the UK.

Is it possible? Or are we just fooling ourselves?"
g7wiz6,23m,United States,['North America'],[],['south america'],hospitality major,2020-04-26,"Hello!! Looking for some advice here. I’m a 23 year old soon to be college graduate in May. I’m finishing a B.S. in Hospitality and Tourism. 

I’m looking to improve my Spanish by immersing myself into Latin culture in South America. Since the pandemic I’ve been let go from my Hotel management job and I’ve been working on a horse farm here in central Kentucky. I am making decent money at the moment. The lease is up on my apartment in July and I’m thinking of moving back in with my Dad while I save up money for moving to South America.

I would like to live down there for a couple years. Hopefully even a different country every 6-9 months or so. I want to explore as much as possible. I’m okay with doing dirty work and will happily do odd jobs to help get by. How should I look for employment? What about visa requirements for a US citizen wanting to spend multiple years abroad? How much should I have saved up before I go?

Hopefully this isn’t too vague! I just have a desire to explore the world!! Thanks for listening. Best wishes."

Citizenship/residency wont be an issue. I'm applying for Croatian citizenship through lineage. If all works out, I'll be a proud EU citizen. 

I speak English and Spanish fluently, and am learning French (but I have a long way to go). I bartend for a living and love it, though I know it doesnt pay as well in Europe. The rest of my work experience is in retail and administrative work. I have a BA in International Affairs/Studies. Other than bartending, none of them paid well and my skills arent that diverse because my city doesnt offer much opportunities for work. 
I'd prefer to keeping bartending, or have work where I get to move around, because I hate sitting at a desk all day. But hey, I'll take what will pay the bills in the end.

However, I'm wondering if the move would be worth what I'd be giving up here. I know Europe is a lot more laid back and has better working conditions, so maybe I wont burn out as easily.

Before the virus, I was objectively doing decently. I only had to work 3 days a week to make enough to cover all my living expenses with a little extra to have fun. I'll pick free time over an extravagant lifestyle anytime, because I get exhausted easily and need a lot of time to rest. (Health stuff) 

Other than all that, I'd prefer living somewhere relatively coastal, with plenty to do and where people are hopefully more friendly and down to earth. Also I have two cats I need to be able to bring with me. 

How feasible would such a move be? Would it be worth it? What do you think would be a good place for me to start over and be able to be financially secure? What are my employment options?

So [this](https://www.sovereignman.com/lifestyle-design/four-valuable-passports-that-anyone-can-obtain-6109/#spain) site says all it takes for me, as a Latin American, to get Spanish citizenship is to prove to the embassy that I've got 25k Euros in my bank account, then go and live there for two years on a non-lucrative resident visa..

This actually sounds doable, which makes me kinda skeptical given how impossible migrating has felt for years.


This info sounds kinda unnecessary but I'll add it just in case: I've got a US BA in International Affairs from a very well regarded school in the subject and 3 (almost 4) years of experience spanning the private, public, and non-profit sectors both in the US and in Costa Rica.

I am also interested in the potential to study somewhere, so suggestions on study locations and information like that would also be helpful. In terms of money, by December/Jan the time that I want to leave by (Covid-19 dependent) I should have at least $40,000NZD saved, so my budget is relatively open

I am interested in moving to the following places: Dublin, London, Brighton, Manchester and am also open to any other suggestions people have as well as any advice or knowledge about the places listed that it would be good to be aware of. I do also worry about the difficulty of making new friends (for example, outside of coworkers/flatmates) so if anyone has advice on forums/apps or just in general advice on how to go about this in big places that would be awesome.

g86kfj,19m,United States,['North America'],[],['asia'],anthro/archaeo student,2020-04-26,"I'm an anthropology and archaeology student in Oregon and have long been interested in the possibility of working as a researcher in the Central Asian -stans and/or Mongolia. My interests are in contemporary nomadism, post-Soviet development and internationalization, processes of ethnic assimilation and preservation (particularly in the relationships, historical and present, between Turkic and Iranic populations in Central Asia, although more recently Russification is a big one), and frontier studies, particularly in relation to migration patterns in the wake of both the Soviet collapse and regional warfare. Since these are obviously some diverse interests (and I have others), I expect to narrow down my focus as I continue my studies over the next few years.

Currently I'm only in my first year of community college, but I plan to transfer to the University of Oregon within a year, where I'll major in anthropology. I have yet to decide whether I'm more interested in cultural anth or archaeology, but they don't offer an archaeology degree as such—I'd have to move east for that. Though I'm studying Persian on my own time right now, I'll also study it formally for the first time there. I also plan to study Russian and probably a Turkic language, maybe Uzbek.

My grades are excellent so far and I'm very interested in maintaining them so as to qualify for as many merit scholarships and grants as I may be eligible for. I'm from a financially disadvantaged background, yet for the time being cannot receive federal financial aid due to circumstances outside of my control, so that's been and will continue to be a major obstacle in realizing my ambitions.

Ideally, I'd like to explore opportunities for research in this region as soon as possible following my BA. I expect my MA to take me out of state at the least and quite possibly out of the US, and for the moment it's impossible to tell where I'll end up. Is it likely that I'll be able to begin fieldwork in this region before undertaking my MA?

My intent is definitely not to move to this region permanently. I'm interested in what steps I should be taking, short-term and long-term, in being able to work in this region within the next few years, and to establish a place for myself in the scholarship around it. What general advice would you give to other would-be scholars in my position? Any particular advice for my case?

g85931,40m,United States,['North America'],['Italy'],['Europe'],software engineer,2020-04-26,"I’ve recently started down the path of obtaining dual citizenship via “Jure Sanguinis”. I actually might have multiple ancestry paths via my father, but based on the documentation I have on hand so far, the line I am planning to use right now is the following:

Great grandfather - born 1878 in Augusta Sicily
Great grandmother - born 1889 in August Sicily

They were married 1911 in Augusta Sicily.  They came to the states shortly after. 

Grandmother was born 1923. 

Great grandfather is naturalized in 1925. 

Father is born in 1952. 

So, based on the concept of citizenship passing through blood (along with the other rules in place), my grandmother was passed Italian citizenship from my great grandfather because he was not yet a US citizen when she was born; because my father was born after 1948, that means he was passed the right to Italian citizenship from Grandma and then so on and so forth. 

So a few questions:

- Am I correct and the interpretation of the rules and how it applies to my case?
- I’ve already been in contact with Augusta’s Registrar of Vital Statistics to obtain the long form birth certificate; is the marriage registration important as well?
- I know this process will take a while (I won’t go to the consulate to apply until Nov of next year), but what are the subsequent steps (if it all works out of course) to getting my wife and child citizenship as well?

g7vpxv,33f,United States,['North America'],['United Kingdom'],['Europe'],accountant/aml analyst,2020-04-26,"Quick background rundown: 

* I am a US citizen with a current passport (renewed this year due to name change).
* I have a bachelor’s in Accounting (May 2019), and an associate’s in Medical Administration with a      Concentration in Medical Transcription (December 2010). 
* I have worked in retail for a little over five years, about four years as a medical transcriptionist/patient registration, four months in data entry, and I am currently working as an AML analyst for a multinational bank as of February 2020. 

I am looking for any available avenue to get to the UK, and I will admit there is a bit of desperation that is creeping through. My fiancé is a British citizen, but due to being a type 1 diabetic and ongoing medical issues, he is unable to work and is barely scraping by with Universal Credit. 

Here is where the desperation is coming in: he has double retinal bleeds, and he is slowly going blind. He has already had two operations on his right eye to correct it, and it started clouding over again while there is blood in the left eye that hinders his vision. 

I have tried looking into several avenues to try and get over to England, which includes: 

**Tier 4 Student Visa**: As stated above, I have my bachelor's, so I was considering going over to obtain a master’s in accounting. However, I do not have the funds for the living expense required to obtain a Tier 4 student visa (£1,105/month when living outside of London, from my research). I would be able to stay at my fiancé’s during that time, but I doubt they would take that into consideration.

**Fiance Visa**: This was another option I had looked into, but our problem is that 1) he cannot work, so he does not meet the minimum salaried requirements, and 2) neither of us have enough in the bank to meet the financial requirements (£16,000, last I checked). I am slowly storing away money, but it would take a few years to get that much, which includes compensating for the exchange rate.

**Work Visa**: I was looking at jobs in the UK, but as a recent graduate with zero job or internship experience, it might be a hard sell to get a company to sponsor me. At that time, I had a dwindling savings account with no means to relocate. Right now, my savings are growing, and I already have a ticket to England for October (originally meant to visit my fiancé until I can move there on a more permanent basis). 

**Current Employment**: Right now, my best shot of making it over to England, in my eyes, is through my current employer. However, I have only been with the company for three months, and they require you to stay in your current position for a year. An exception may be possible if I could make a vertical movement within the company, but I believe they would only do that for someone with more seniority (and skill). 

I could make a plea, with my manager, to relocate to England for six months to help my fiancé, which is only possible due to a majority of our workforce working from home for the foreseeable future. I doubt it will go anywhere, but I am going to speak to him, off the record, about the possibility and what hoops I would need to jump through if it is. 

I have read where people have entered the country and started job hunting that way. Still, I want to remain as legitimate in my immigration as possible to avoid any kind of fallout (such as preventing me from marrying my fiancé). I have looked through everything I could think of, and I am trying to think logically about my situation.

So I currently live in Zimbabwe, but fear there aren't many opportunities here for growth, and a stable job. So I was wondering how I can somehow move to South America and get a job there.

To give you some context, I have a Masters degree in Quantitative Risk Management from the University of Cape Town, in South Africa. I work well with the programming languages Python, R,  MATLAB and Stata, and have about 1.5 years experience in the business analyst/financial analyst role.

I am open to moving to any country in South America but would prefer Brazil/Argentina.

I'm run an agriculture IOT startup I'm funding with the $1.5M I got from a previous startup (where I was an early employee).  It more than qualifies for the capital requirements for DAFT or the Irish startup program ([https://workpermit.com/immigration/ireland/irish-visa-start-entrepreneur-programme](https://workpermit.com/immigration/ireland/irish-visa-start-entrepreneur-programme)). 

I don't have a degree, but I am a high earner (300k-500k/year).

If I get temporary residency through the entrepreneur programs can I reasonably expect permanent residency after 5 years?  Will not having a degree hinder me?

Should I just delete this thread and wait for the responses from the actual immigration attorneys I have messaged?  Has anyone else done this kind of move?

My husband has a severe form of epilepsy and is unable to work, and I am his carer. He receives a disability allowance that covers our expenses, some of which is provided since I am his carer.

I have read varying things about whether he can still claim his Belgian disability benefits while living in the UK. It is the main thing stopping us as we have no other means of income as I am unable to work due to his condition. 

We are getting older now and I find it very lonely and difficult being in Belgium, quite honestly I feel trapped there. When he is ill he is ‘not there’ and I am alone looking after him for days, weeks to sometimes months depending on the severity of his health. When we are back in the UK I have the support of my family and it’s such a relief to me to know they can pop over to see how we are doing. In Belgium we are alone. 

I have tried to look for what possibilities there would be for us but it’s such a difficult situation with his health, inability to work, my inability to work. We are desperate to make this move but we only can if he still receives his disability allowance when we are in the UK.

Is it possible? Or are we just fooling ourselves?"

I speak English and Spanish fluently, and am learning French (but I have a long way to go). I bartend for a living and love it, though I know it doesnt pay as well in Europe. The rest of my work experience is in retail and administrative work. I have a BA in International Affairs/Studies. Other than bartending, none of them paid well and my skills arent that diverse because my city doesnt offer much opportunities for work. 
I'd prefer to keeping bartending, or have work where I get to move around, because I hate sitting at a desk all day. But hey, I'll take what will pay the bills in the end.

However, I'm wondering if the move would be worth what I'd be giving up here. I know Europe is a lot more laid back and has better working conditions, so maybe I wont burn out as easily.

Before the virus, I was objectively doing decently. I only had to work 3 days a week to make enough to cover all my living expenses with a little extra to have fun. I'll pick free time over an extravagant lifestyle anytime, because I get exhausted easily and need a lot of time to rest. (Health stuff) 

Other than all that, I'd prefer living somewhere relatively coastal, with plenty to do and where people are hopefully more friendly and down to earth. Also I have two cats I need to be able to bring with me.

My interests are in contemporary nomadism, post-Soviet development and internationalization, processes of ethnic assimilation and preservation (particularly in the relationships, historical and present, between Turkic and Iranic populations in Central Asia, although more recently Russification is a big one), and frontier studies, particularly in relation to migration patterns in the wake of both the Soviet collapse and regional warfare. Since these are obviously some diverse interests (and I have others), I expect to narrow down my focus as I continue my studies over the next few years.

Currently I'm only in my first year of community college, but I plan to transfer to the University of Oregon within a year, where I'll major in anthropology. I have yet to decide whether I'm more interested in cultural anth or archaeology, but they don't offer an archaeology degree as such—I'd have to move east for that. Though I'm studying Persian on my own time right now, I'll also study it formally for the first time there. I also plan to study Russian and probably a Turkic language, maybe Uzbek.

My grades are excellent so far and I'm very interested in maintaining them so as to qualify for as many merit scholarships and grants as I may be eligible for. I'm from a financially disadvantaged background, yet for the time being cannot receive federal financial aid due to circumstances outside of my control, so that's been and will continue to be a major obstacle in realizing my ambitions.

Ideally, I'd like to explore opportunities for research in this region as soon as possible following my BA. I expect my MA to take me out of state at the least and quite possibly out of the US, and for the moment it's impossible to tell where I'll end up. Is it likely that I'll be able to begin fieldwork in this region before undertaking my MA?

g85931,40m,United States,['North America'],['Italy'],['Europe'],software engineer,2020-04-26,"I’ve recently started down the path of obtaining dual citizenship via “Jure Sanguinis”. I actually might have multiple ancestry paths via my father, but based on the documentation I have on hand so far, the line I am planning to use right now is the following:

Great grandfather - born 1878 in Augusta Sicily
Great grandmother - born 1889 in August Sicily

They were married 1911 in Augusta Sicily.  They came to the states shortly after. 

Grandmother was born 1923. 

Great grandfather is naturalized in 1925. 

Father is born in 1952. 

So, based on the concept of citizenship passing through blood (along with the other rules in place), my grandmother was passed Italian citizenship from my great grandfather because he was not yet a US citizen when she was born; because my father was born after 1948, that means he was passed the right to Italian citizenship from Grandma and then so on and so forth. 

So a few questions:

- Am I correct and the interpretation of the rules and how it applies to my case?
- I’ve already been in contact with Augusta’s Registrar of Vital Statistics to obtain the long form birth certificate; is the marriage registration important as well?
- I know this process will take a while (I won’t go to the consulate to apply until Nov of next year), but what are the subsequent steps (if it all works out of course) to getting my wife and child citizenship as well?

* I am a US citizen with a current passport (renewed this year due to name change).
* I have a bachelor’s in Accounting (May 2019), and an associate’s in Medical Administration with a      Concentration in Medical Transcription (December 2010). 
* I have worked in retail for a little over five years, about four years as a medical transcriptionist/patient registration, four months in data entry, and I am currently working as an AML analyst for a multinational bank as of February 2020. 

I am looking for any available avenue to get to the UK, and I will admit there is a bit of desperation that is creeping through. My fiancé is a British citizen, but due to being a type 1 diabetic and ongoing medical issues, he is unable to work and is barely scraping by with Universal Credit. 

Here is where the desperation is coming in: he has double retinal bleeds, and he is slowly going blind. He has already had two operations on his right eye to correct it, and it started clouding over again while there is blood in the left eye that hinders his vision. 

I have tried looking into several avenues to try and get over to England, which includes: 

**Tier 4 Student Visa**: As stated above, I have my bachelor's, so I was considering going over to obtain a master’s in accounting. However, I do not have the funds for the living expense required to obtain a Tier 4 student visa (£1,105/month when living outside of London, from my research). I would be able to stay at my fiancé’s during that time, but I doubt they would take that into consideration.

**Fiance Visa**: This was another option I had looked into, but our problem is that 1) he cannot work, so he does not meet the minimum salaried requirements, and 2) neither of us have enough in the bank to meet the financial requirements (£16,000, last I checked). I am slowly storing away money, but it would take a few years to get that much, which includes compensating for the exchange rate.

**Work Visa**: I was looking at jobs in the UK, but as a recent graduate with zero job or internship experience, it might be a hard sell to get a company to sponsor me. At that time, I had a dwindling savings account with no means to relocate. Right now, my savings are growing, and I already have a ticket to England for October (originally meant to visit my fiancé until I can move there on a more permanent basis). 

**Current Employment**: Right now, my best shot of making it over to England, in my eyes, is through my current employer. However, I have only been with the company for three months, and they require you to stay in your current position for a year. An exception may be possible if I could make a vertical movement within the company, but I believe they would only do that for someone with more seniority (and skill). 

I could make a plea, with my manager, to relocate to England for six months to help my fiancé, which is only possible due to a majority of our workforce working from home for the foreseeable future. I doubt it will go anywhere, but I am going to speak to him, off the record, about the possibility and what hoops I would need to jump through if it is. 

I have read where people have entered the country and started job hunting that way. Still, I want to remain as legitimate in my immigration as possible to avoid any kind of fallout (such as preventing me from marrying my fiancé). I have looked through everything I could think of, and I am trying to think logically about my situation. 

There was some consideration about bringing my fiancé over to the US, but I’m terrified our whole healthcare system (mostly insurance) would kill him. Despite working for a multinational bank, the health insurance I have isn’t that great, and what would I do if I lost my job when he got here?  

I am trying to familiarize myself with UK KYC/AML and have been attempting to become more acquainted with Excel formulas. However, while my current job uses Excel, they are big fans of pivot tables and not much else. I am also working on a CV and will attempt to apply to companies in the UK. 

I may be S.O.L. right now, but I would not be able to forgive myself if I didn’t try exhausting every possibility. Thank you for any and all advice."
